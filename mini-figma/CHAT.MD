# Mini-Figma: Development Chat Summary

This document outlines the key milestones, features implemented, and significant events during the collaborative development of the Mini-Figma web application. The project was a pair programming effort between a human user (USER) and an AI assistant (Gemini 2.5 Pro).

## 1. Project Inception & Planning

*   **Initial Request:** USER initiated the project to create a web-based 2D vector editor named `mini-figma`.
*   **Core Requirements Defined:**
    *   Infinite canvas with smooth zooming and panning.
    *   Toolbar with icons (Feather Icons suggested).
    *   Tools: Selection, Pen, Rectangle, Ellipse, Text.
    *   Properties Panel (right) for selected object attributes.
    *   Layers Panel (left) for object order and visibility.
    *   Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas 2D API (no WebGL/WASM).
    *   Goal: Simplest code for essential features, modular, extensible but not over-abstracted, minimal comments.
*   **AI Proposed Plan:** A multi-phase plan was outlined by the AI, covering project setup, core UI, canvas/rendering, state management, tool implementation, properties panel, layers panel, and enhancements. USER approved the plan.

## 2. Phase 1: Project Setup & Core UI Shell

*   The `mini-figma` directory was created.
*   A Vite React + TypeScript project was initialized (`npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`).
*   Dependencies were installed (`npm install`).
*   A project-specific `.gitignore` file was created for `mini-figma`.
*   Placeholder React components were created in `src/components/`:
    *   `Toolbar.tsx`
    *   `LayersPanel.tsx`
    *   `CanvasView.tsx`
    *   `PropertiesPanel.tsx`
*   `App.tsx` was updated to arrange these components using basic flexbox styling.
*   `App.css` was cleaned up, removing default Vite styles and adding a basic CSS reset. Some debugging was required as the AI initially struggled to fully replace the file content, requiring manual intervention by the USER to confirm the CSS was correct.

## 3. Phase 2: Canvas, Rendering, and State Management

*   `CanvasView.tsx` was updated to include an actual HTML5 `<canvas>` element, with initial logic for getting the 2D context and basic rendering.
*   `feather-icons` and `react-feather` were installed for toolbar icons.
*   TypeScript type definitions (`src/types/canvas.ts`) were created for:
    *   `ToolType` enum.
    *   `CanvasObjectBase` and specific object interfaces (`RectangleObject`, `EllipseObject`, `PathObject`, `TextObject`).
    *   `AppState` to hold the application state.
*   `zustand` was installed for state management.
*   A Zustand store (`src/store/store.ts`) was set up with `initialState` and basic actions.
*   **Key Decision:** `nanoid` (initially proposed by AI for ID generation) was replaced with a simpler custom ID generator (`generateId`) to reduce dependencies, aligning with the project goal of simplicity.
*   Addressed TypeScript linter errors related to type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`) and type compatibility in store actions.

## 4. Phase 3: Toolbar & Tool Implementation (Iterative)

*   **Toolbar (`Toolbar.tsx`):**
    *   Populated with tool buttons using Feather Icons.
    *   Connected buttons to the Zustand store to set `activeTool`.
    *   Corrected Zustand store access pattern for actions.
    *   Improved icon visibility by adding a `color` prop.
*   **General Tool State:** `drawingState` was added to `AppState` and store actions (`startDrawing`, `endDrawing`, etc.) were created to manage the process of creating new shapes/paths.
*   **Rectangle Tool (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented mouse event handlers (`handleMouseDown`, `handleMouseMove`, `handleMouseUp`) for click-and-drag and single-click creation.
    *   Objects rendered from the store.
*   **Ellipse Tool (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented similarly to the Rectangle tool.
    *   **Refinement:** Interaction was changed from center-based drawing to a bounding-box definition (click corner, drag to size) for consistency with the Rectangle tool, based on USER feedback.
*   **Pen Tool (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented logic for adding points sequentially on `mousedown`.
    *   Paths rendered by connecting points.
    *   Added a live preview line from the last point to the cursor during path creation.
    *   Implemented path finalization by selecting another tool (which calls `endDrawing`).
    *   **Enhancements (USER request):**
        *   Pressing `ESC` finalizes the current path.
        *   Clicking near the path's starting node closes the path.
*   **Selection Tool (Initial Implementation in `CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented hit-testing logic for Rectangles, Ellipses, and Path *points*.
    *   Updated `selectedObjectIds` in the store upon successful hit.
    *   Added visual feedback (bounding box or point highlights) for selected objects.
    *   **Refinement (USER request):** Path selection was improved to allow clicking on path *segments* rather than just nodes, using a point-to-line-segment distance calculation.
*   **Text Tool (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented creation of `TextObject` on canvas click with default properties.
    *   Added text rendering using `ctx.fillText()`.
    *   Basic bounding box hit-testing for text selection.

## 5. Phase 4: Properties Panel Implementation (`PropertiesPanel.tsx`)

*   Connected to the Zustand store to display properties of the single selected object.
*   Added input fields for common properties: Name (added later), ID (read-only), X, Y, Opacity.
*   Added input fields for shape-specific properties:
    *   Rectangle: Width, Height, Fill Color.
    *   Ellipse: Radius X, Radius Y, Fill Color.
    *   Path: Stroke Color, Stroke Width.
    *   Text: Content (textarea), Font Size, Font Family, Fill Color.
*   Implemented two-way data binding (panel changes update canvas objects).
*   **Debugging:** Resolved a "Maximum update depth exceeded" React error by refining Zustand selectors (making them more granular) and ensuring event handlers (`makeChangeHandler`) were structured to avoid stale closures and unnecessary re-renders.
*   UI polish: Darkened panel titles for better visibility (USER feedback).
*   **Bug Fix (USER observation):** Corrected logic so that changing a Path object's X/Y position in the Properties Panel correctly translates all its constituent points.

## 6. Phase 5: Layers Panel Implementation (`LayersPanel.tsx`)

*   Connected to the Zustand store to display `objects` and `selectedObjectIds`.
*   Displayed objects in reverse order to represent the visual top-to-bottom layer stack.
*   Highlighted the layer item corresponding to the selected object.
*   Enabled clicking on a layer item to select the object on the canvas.
*   **Refinement (USER request):**
    *   Removed detailed properties (W/H) from layer items.
    *   Added a `name` property to all `CanvasObjectBase` types.
    *   Updated object creation in `CanvasView.tsx` to assign default names.
    *   Updated `PropertiesPanel.tsx` to allow viewing and editing the object `name`.
    *   Layers Panel now displays an icon (from `react-feather`) for the object type and its `name` (or a fallback). Style adjustments made for clarity.

## 7. Phase 6: Canvas Interactions & Advanced Features

*   **Object Dragging (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented logic to drag selected objects (Rectangles, Ellipses, Paths, Text) using the Selection Tool.
    *   Updated `drawingState` in the store to include `isDragging` and related properties.
    *   Path object points are correctly translated during drag.
*   **Panning (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented canvas panning by holding `Spacebar` + Mouse Drag, or Middle Mouse Button + Drag.
    *   Added `isPanning` and related properties to `drawingState`.
    *   Updated rendering and mouse coordinate calculations to account for pan.
*   **Zooming (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented canvas zooming using the mouse wheel.
    *   Zooming is centered around the mouse cursor position.
    *   Updated rendering (including selection outlines, handle sizes, preview lines) and mouse coordinate calculations to account for zoom.
*   **Cursor Updates (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Cursor changes to 'grab'/'grabbing' for panning.
    *   Cursor changed to default for object dragging (USER request).
    *   Resize cursors implemented for handles.
*   **Viewport Fix:** Resolved an issue where the application only took up 50% of the viewport by removing centering styles from `body` in `mini-figma/src/index.css` (USER observation).
*   **Resize Handles (`CanvasView.tsx`):**
    *   Added 8 resize handles to selected Rectangles and Ellipses.
    *   Implemented drawing of handles (visual size adjusted for zoom).
    *   Implemented hit-testing for handles.
    *   Mouse event logic (`handleMouseDown`, `handleMouseMove`, `handleMouseUp`) updated to manage resizing operations, updating object dimensions based on handle dragged.
    *   `drawingState` in store updated with `isResizing`, `activeHandle`, and `resizeObjectSnapshot`.
    *   ESC key cancels an active resize operation.
