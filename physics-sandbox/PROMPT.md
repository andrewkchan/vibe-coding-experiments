Build a physics sandbox in the directory `physics-sandbox`. The program should run in my web browser and allow me to manipulate physics objects such as bouncing balls, rigid bodies, and cloth with my mouse in a 3D environment.

Work only in the directory `physics-sandbox`. Do not edit files outside. Make a plan before beginning to code in a file `PLAN.MD`, feel free to add any features you feel are important or ask me clarifying questions when making the plan.
