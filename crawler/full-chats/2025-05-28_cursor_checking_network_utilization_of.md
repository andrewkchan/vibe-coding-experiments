**User**

I am trying to understand my crawler's resource utilization. From previous discussions, I tuned down the max workers in this asyncio-based crawler (you can check the "cursor_sqlite_concurrency..." file in `crawler/full-chats` if you are curious) due to file descriptor limits. Now I am worried it is underutilizing the network (which IIUC would likely be main bottleneck otherwise). 

My crawler is currently running, how can I check the network utilization?

I'll help you check the network utilization of your running crawler. Let me first look at your crawler configuration to understand the context better.

Let me check the crawler's architecture and current configuration to better understand your setup before helping you monitor network utilization.

Now I understand better. You have an asyncio-based crawler that was tuned down from 100 workers due to file descriptor limits. Let me help you check the network utilization to see if the crawler is underutilizing the network after this tuning.

Here are several ways to monitor network utilization on your Linux system:

## 1. Real-time Network Monitoring with `iftop`

```bash
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install iftop

# Monitor network traffic (requires sudo)
sudo iftop -n  # -n prevents DNS lookups for faster display
```

This will show:
- Real-time bandwidth usage per connection
- Total TX/RX rates at the bottom
- Peak and average rates

## 2. System-wide Network Statistics with `nload`

```bash
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install nload

# Run nload
nload
```

This gives a nice graph of incoming/outgoing traffic with current, average, and max speeds.

## 3. Quick Network Stats with `ifstat`

```bash
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install ifstat

# Monitor all interfaces with 1-second updates
ifstat -a 1
```

## 4. Using `vnstat` for Historical Data

```bash
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install vnstat

# View current bandwidth
vnstat -l  # Live monitoring

# View hourly stats
vnstat -h

# View daily stats
vnstat -d
```

## 5. Process-specific Network Usage with `nethogs`

Since you want to see your crawler's specific network usage:

```bash
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install nethogs

# Monitor per-process bandwidth
sudo nethogs
```

This will show network usage by process, so you can see exactly how much bandwidth your Python crawler process is using.

## 6. Quick Command-line Check

For a quick check without installing anything:

```bash
# Check current network stats
cat /proc/net/dev

# Or use ip command for real-time monitoring (watch updates every 1 second)
watch -n 1 'ip -s link show'

# Check network interface speed/capacity
ethtool eth0 | grep Speed  # Replace eth0 with your interface name
```

## 7. Monitoring with `ss` or `netstat`

To see how many active connections your crawler has:

```bash
# Count established connections from your crawler process
# First find your crawler PID
ps aux | grep python | grep crawler

# Then count connections for that PID (replace PID with actual number)
sudo ss -tanp | grep "pid=PID" | grep ESTAB | wc -l

# Or see all connections from python processes
sudo ss -tanp | grep python | grep ESTAB
```

## Recommendations for Your Crawler

Given your crawler's architecture with the tuned-down workers, I'd suggest:

1. **Start with `nethogs`** to see your crawler's specific bandwidth usage
2. **Use `iftop`** to see if you're hitting network limits
3. **Check connection count** with `ss` to ensure you're using your available workers effectively

Also, let me check your current crawler configuration to see what the worker count is set to:

```shellscript
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install iftop

# Monitor network traffic (requires sudo)
sudo iftop -n  # -n prevents DNS lookups for faster display
```

```shellscript
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install nload

# Run nload
nload
```

```shellscript
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install ifstat

# Monitor all interfaces with 1-second updates
ifstat -a 1
```

```shellscript
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install vnstat

# View current bandwidth
vnstat -l  # Live monitoring

# View hourly stats
vnstat -h

# View daily stats
vnstat -d
```

```shellscript
# Install if not already present
sudo apt-get install nethogs

# Monitor per-process bandwidth
sudo nethogs
```

```shellscript
# Check current network stats
cat /proc/net/dev

# Or use ip command for real-time monitoring (watch updates every 1 second)
watch -n 1 'ip -s link show'

# Check network interface speed/capacity
ethtool eth0 | grep Speed  # Replace eth0 with your interface name
```

```shellscript
# Count established connections from your crawler process
# First find your crawler PID
ps aux | grep python | grep crawler

# Then count connections for that PID (replace PID with actual number)
sudo ss -tanp | grep "pid=PID" | grep ESTAB | wc -l

# Or see all connections from python processes
sudo ss -tanp | grep python | grep ESTAB
```

I can see the default is now set to 20 workers (down from the 100 mentioned in the chat history). Based on your concern about underutilizing the network, here's what I recommend checking:

## Quick Network Utilization Check

Run these commands to get immediate insights:

```bash
# 1. Check your crawler's current network usage
sudo nethogs -t | grep python

# 2. See total bandwidth usage on your main network interface
# First identify your interface
ip link show
# Then monitor it (replace eth0 with your interface)
ifstat -i eth0 1

# 3. Count active connections from your crawler
# Find your crawler PID first
ps aux | grep "python.*crawler" | grep -v grep
# Then count connections (replace PID)
sudo ss -tanp | grep "pid=PID" | grep ESTAB | wc -l

# 4. Check if you're hitting the connection limits in aiohttp
# Look for the connection pool stats in your logs
grep -i "connection" your_crawler.log | tail -20
```

## Network Utilization Indicators

Your crawler might be underutilizing the network if:

1. **Low bandwidth usage**: If `nethogs` shows your crawler using much less than your available bandwidth
2. **Few active connections**: If connection count is much lower than your worker count (20)
3. **CPU idle**: If `top` shows low CPU usage, it might indicate waiting on network I/O
4. **Frontier not empty**: If you have many URLs waiting but low network activity

To get a comprehensive view, you could also create a simple monitoring script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as monitor_crawler.sh and chmod +x

echo "=== Crawler Network Monitoring ==="
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop"
echo ""

# Find crawler PID
CRAWLER_PID=$(ps aux | grep "python.*main.py" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')

if [ -z "$CRAWLER_PID" ]; then
    echo "Crawler not found running"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Crawler PID: $CRAWLER_PID"
echo ""

while true; do
    clear
    echo "=== $(date) ==="
    echo ""
    
    # Network stats
    echo "Network Usage:"
    ifstat -i eth0 1 1 | tail -1
    echo ""
    
    # Connection count
    echo "Active Connections:"
    sudo ss -tanp | grep "pid=$CRAWLER_PID" | grep ESTAB | wc -l
    echo ""
    
    # Process stats
    echo "Process Stats:"
    ps -p $CRAWLER_PID -o %cpu,%mem,cmd --no-headers
    echo ""
    
    sleep 5
done
```

Would you like me to help you interpret the results once you run these monitoring commands? Or would you like me to look at your crawler logs to see if there are any indicators of network underutilization?

```shellscript
# 1. Check your crawler's current network usage
sudo nethogs -t | grep python

# 2. See total bandwidth usage on your main network interface
# First identify your interface
ip link show
# Then monitor it (replace eth0 with your interface)
ifstat -i eth0 1

# 3. Count active connections from your crawler
# Find your crawler PID first
ps aux | grep "python.*crawler" | grep -v grep
# Then count connections (replace PID)
sudo ss -tanp | grep "pid=PID" | grep ESTAB | wc -l

# 4. Check if you're hitting the connection limits in aiohttp
# Look for the connection pool stats in your logs
grep -i "connection" your_crawler.log | tail -20
```

```shellscript
#!/bin/bash
# Save as monitor_crawler.sh and chmod +x

echo "=== Crawler Network Monitoring ==="
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop"
echo ""

    echo "Crawler not found running"
    exit 1

**User**

Any thoughts on these stats from nload comparing the avg to max bandwidth?

I am pasting in a bunch of text which is probably better viewed as an ASCII diagram, let me know if its too confusing for you as an LLM

---

**Cursor**

I can read the ASCII diagram perfectly! This is from `nload` showing your network traffic patterns, and it reveals something very interesting about your crawler's network utilization.

## Key Observations:

1. **Incoming (Download) Traffic**:
   - Current: 1.12 Mbit/s
   - Average: 511.41 Kbit/s (≈ 0.5 Mbit/s)
   - Max: 1.71 Mbit/s
   - Total: 581.06 MB

2. **Outgoing (Upload) Traffic**:
   - Current: 45.28 Mbit/s
   - Average: 35.58 Mbit/s
   - Max: 53.48 Mbit/s
   - Total: 7.65 GB

## Analysis:

Your crawler shows a **very unusual traffic pattern** for a web crawler:

1. **Extremely high upload vs download ratio**: You're uploading ~70x more data than downloading! This is backwards for a crawler, which should primarily download web pages.

2. **Low download bandwidth utilization**: 
   - Average of only 0.5 Mbit/s download is quite low for a crawler
   - The graph shows minimal incoming traffic (mostly dots and small spikes)
   - This suggests your crawler IS underutilizing the network for its primary purpose (downloading pages)

3. **Massive upload traffic**: 
   - The solid blocks (########) on the outgoing graph indicate sustained high upload
   - 35-45 Mbit/s upload is enormous for a crawler

## Possible Explanations:

1. **Are you accidentally uploading content somewhere?** Check if your crawler is:
   - Posting large amounts of data to an API
   - Uploading to cloud storage
   - Sending very large requests (though HTTP requests should be small)

2. **SSH/rsync running?** If you're viewing this over SSH and simultaneously syncing files, that could explain the upload.

3. **Database replication?** Are you replicating your SQLite database somewhere?

Let me help you investigate:

The code search doesn't show any upload operations. Let me check what processes are actually using the network:

```bash
# Check what's using the bandwidth right now
sudo nethogs -t

# Or check specific network connections
sudo ss -tanp | grep ESTAB | awk '{print $5, $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

# Check if there are any unexpected services running
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
```

Also, to verify this is actually your crawler's traffic:

```bash
# Stop your crawler temporarily and watch if the upload traffic drops
# Then restart it and see if it comes back
```

## For Your Crawler's Performance:

The **low incoming bandwidth** (avg 0.5 Mbit/s) confirms your suspicion - your crawler IS underutilizing the network for downloading. With 20 workers, you should be able to sustain much higher download rates.

Possible reasons for low download utilization:
1. **Too few concurrent connections** - only 20 workers might be too conservative
2. **Long delays between requests** - the 70-second politeness delay per domain
3. **Small frontier** - not enough diverse domains to crawl in parallel
4. **Connection pool limits** - the aiohttp connector limits might be too restrictive

To improve download utilization, you could:
1. Increase workers back up (maybe to 50?)
2. Ensure your seed list has diverse domains
3. Check your logs for any throttling or rate limiting

But first, we need to figure out what's causing that massive upload traffic - that's not normal for a crawler!

```shellscript
# Check what's using the bandwidth right now
sudo nethogs -t

# Or check specific network connections
sudo ss -tanp | grep ESTAB | awk '{print $5, $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

# Check if there are any unexpected services running
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
```

```shellscript
# Stop your crawler temporarily and watch if the upload traffic drops
# Then restart it and see if it comes back
```

The crawler is currently in the initialization phase where it is probing 1 million seed domains for robots.txt, most of the requests fail with 4xx errors, maybe that is why?

---

**Cursor**

Ah, that explains it! Yes, the unusual traffic pattern makes sense now. Let me break down what's happening:

## Why High Upload During robots.txt Probing:

1. **HTTP Request Overhead**: Even though robots.txt requests are simple GET requests, with 1 million domains and many failing, you're sending a lot of:
   - DNS queries (upstream traffic)
   - TCP SYN packets for connection attempts
   - HTTP request headers (typically 300-500 bytes each)
   - TLS handshake data for HTTPS sites

2. **Failed Connections Generate More Traffic**: When requests fail (4xx errors, timeouts, connection refused), there's often:
   - Multiple retry attempts
   - TCP RST packets
   - DNS retries for failed domains
   - Error responses that still require acknowledgments

3. **The Math**: 
   - 1 million domains × ~500 bytes per request = ~500 MB base
   - Add retries, DNS, TCP overhead, TLS: easily 5-10x more
   - This could explain several GB of upload traffic

## Why Low Download:

- Most requests failing with 4xx means you're not downloading actual content
- robots.txt files are typically small (few KB)
- Failed requests return minimal data

## Network Utilization Assessment:

Your network is actually **not underutilized** during this phase - it's just being used differently than during normal crawling:
- High upload: Sending many requests
- Low download: Most requests fail, little content returned

## Suggestions:

1. **This is temporary**: Once you move past initialization and start crawling actual pages from successful domains, you should see:
   - Download traffic increase dramatically (HTML pages are larger)
   - Upload/download ratio normalize

2. **Monitor after initialization**: The real test of network utilization will be during actual page crawling

3. **You could optimize initialization** by:
   ```python
   # Increase concurrent robots.txt fetches during init
   # Since these are lighter than full page fetches
   async def fetch_robots_txt_batch(domains, max_concurrent=100):
       # Use a semaphore to limit concurrent fetches
       sem = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)
       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           tasks = [fetch_with_sem(session, sem, domain) for domain in domains]
           return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
   ```

4. **Check your worker utilization** during actual crawling:
   ```bash
   # After initialization completes, monitor:
   # - Active connections
   # - Download bandwidth
   # - Worker activity in logs
   ```

Would you like to wait for the initialization to complete and then check the network stats again during actual page crawling? That will give you a better picture of whether your 20 workers are sufficient for your network capacity.

```python
   # Increase concurrent robots.txt fetches during init
   # Since these are lighter than full page fetches
   async def fetch_robots_txt_batch(domains, max_concurrent=100):
       # Use a semaphore to limit concurrent fetches
       sem = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)
       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           tasks = [fetch_with_sem(session, sem, domain) for domain in domains]
           return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

```shellscript
   # After initialization completes, monitor:
   # - Active connections
   # - Download bandwidth
   # - Worker activity in logs
```
