# Debugging crawler scalability issues

**User**

Let's continue debugging our crawler scalability. We last left off with adding a missing index that we hypothesized would fix the issue where the query in `_atomic_claim_urls` can take ~seconds with millions of entries in the frontier. See the chat log `crawler/full-chats/cursor_debugging_crawler_connection_iss_g25pro.md`. After adding this and resuming the crawler, the database is no longer immediately "falling over" and the crawler run displays high throughput and resource utilization (from manually observing the change in visited_urls over time and spot checks to `nload`). However, the utilization still falls after several hours, with logs showing long query warnings in the same function (although it is not happening constantly).

To begin debugging this, I have attached the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` query (simulating the atomic claim query) that you suggested last time:
```
                                                                                        QUERY PLAN

**Cursor**

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output you've provided is excellent news in one sense: it shows that when PostgreSQL executes the query with up-to-date information and uses the `idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time` index, the query is extremely fast (Execution Time: 0.972 ms). This confirms the index is well-designed for the task.

However, the fact that performance degrades after several hours, with the same query sometimes taking seconds, points to other factors. The most common culprits for this kind of behavior in a busy PostgreSQL table are:

1.  **Table Bloat**: The `frontier` table experiences a high volume of `UPDATE` operations as URLs are claimed. PostgreSQL's MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) means that old versions of rows ("dead tuples") aren't immediately removed. If these dead tuples accumulate faster than the `VACUUM` process can clean them up, the table becomes bloated. This makes queries, even index-based ones, slower because PostgreSQL has to sift through more data pages, some of which contain mostly dead tuples.

2.  **Stale Statistics**: PostgreSQL's query planner relies on statistics about the data distribution within tables to make optimal choices. These statistics are updated by `ANALYZE` (which autovacuum also runs). If the characteristics of your `frontier` table change significantly over hours of crawling (e.g., the ratio of claimed to unclaimed URLs, the distribution of `added_timestamp` values) and `ANALYZE` hasn't run recently enough or frequently enough, the planner might be working with outdated information. This *could* lead to suboptimal plan choices, but more often with a good index like yours, it means the cost estimates are off, and the query takes longer than expected due to bloat that the planner isn't fully accounting for.

3.  **Autovacuum Not Keeping Pace**: PostgreSQL has an autovacuum daemon that is supposed to handle vacuuming (removing dead tuples) and analyzing (updating statistics) automatically. However, for very high-traffic tables like your `frontier` table might become, the default autovacuum settings might not be aggressive enough to keep up with the rate of change.

**Next Diagnostic Steps:**

To confirm these suspicions, I recommend the following:

1.  **Inspect Table Statistics and Autovacuum Status for `frontier`**:
    When you next observe a slowdown, or even periodically, connect to your PostgreSQL database and run these queries:
    *   To check for bloat (dead tuples) and when autovacuum/autoanalyze last ran:
        ```sql
        SELECT
            schemaname, relname,
            n_live_tup, n_dead_tup,
            last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
            last_analyze, last_autoanalyze,
            vacuum_count, autovacuum_count,
            analyze_count, autoanalyze_count
        FROM pg_stat_user_tables
        WHERE relname = 'frontier';
        ```
        Pay attention to `n_dead_tup`. A high number relative to `n_live_tup` indicates bloat. Check if `last_autovacuum` and `last_autoanalyze` are recent.

    *   To see if autovacuum is currently working on the table or if there are active long queries:
        ```sql
        SELECT pid, datname, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, backend_start, query_start, query
        FROM pg_stat_activity
        WHERE query ILIKE '%frontier%' OR query ILIKE '%autovacuum%heap%';
        ```
        This can show you if an autovacuum process for `frontier` is running or stuck, or if other queries might be interfering.

2.  **Attempt to Capture `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` During a Slowdown**:
    This is the most valuable piece of information. If you can catch one of the multi-second executions of the `_atomic_claim_urls` query and run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (with appropriate values for batch size and timestamp) *at that moment*, the output would reveal if the query plan has changed or, more likely, if the execution time of specific nodes in the (still good) plan has ballooned. This can be tricky to time perfectly.

3.  **Consider More Frequent/Manual `ANALYZE` or `VACUUM` (as a test)**:
    *   If you suspect stale statistics, you could try manually running `ANALYZE frontier;` when you notice a slowdown, or even proactively every hour or so, to see if it restores performance.
    *   If bloat is a major issue, a `VACUUM frontier;` (which can run concurrently with reads/writes) might be necessary. This is more resource-intensive than just `ANALYZE`.
    *   **Note**: `VACUUM FULL frontier;` would reclaim more space but locks the table exclusively, so it's not suitable for a running crawler.

4.  **Review Autovacuum Configuration for `frontier`**:
    If autovacuum isn't keeping up, you might need to tune its parameters specifically for the `frontier` table to make it more aggressive. This can be done via `ALTER TABLE frontier SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = ..., autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = ...);` (e.g., lowering the scale factors from the defaults of 0.2 and 0.1 respectively, to trigger vacuum/analyze more often). This is a more advanced step, usually taken after confirming autovacuum is the bottleneck.

The current `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` being fast is a good sign. It means the query and index are fundamentally sound. The problem is very likely related to database maintenance and the effects of high churn over time.

Let me know what you find from inspecting `pg_stat_user_tables` and `pg_stat_activity` when the crawler starts to slow down. That will give us more direct evidence.

```sql
        SELECT
            schemaname, relname,
            n_live_tup, n_dead_tup,
            last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
            last_analyze, last_autoanalyze,
            vacuum_count, autovacuum_count,
            analyze_count, autoanalyze_count
        FROM pg_stat_user_tables
        WHERE relname = 'frontier';
```

```sql
        SELECT pid, datname, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, backend_start, query_start, query
        FROM pg_stat_activity
        WHERE query ILIKE '%frontier%' OR query ILIKE '%autovacuum%heap%';
```

I ran the pgstats queries you suggested and the frontier table does not look that bloated (~170k dead tuples vs >9M live tuples). Just in case I ran VACUUM frontier.

I also noticed other traces in the latest run for a different query (a politeness query for manual exclusion). Actually, after the indexing fixes for the frontier table, the politeness traces occur more often (but both still occur). Example:
```

I saw this query does a simple fetch_one on domain_metadata, so I also ran pgstats for that table and saw that while it wasn't significantly bloated, the last vacuum ran 3 days ago, so I ran VACUUM domain_metadata.

However, after resuming the crawler, both long connection traces (politeness and atomic_claim_urls) still occur. For some reason, I wasn't able to capture a slow politeness query plan, but I did capture a atomic_claim_urls query plan which took more than usual (several milliseconds) after repeatedly sampling:
```
 Update on frontier  (cost=1.01..26.03 rows=3 width=42) (actual time=5.107..5.722 rows=3 loops=1)
   CTE to_claim
     ->  Limit  (cost=0.43..0.58 rows=3 width=91) (actual time=4.994..5.039 rows=3 loops=1)
           ->  LockRows  (cost=0.43..431656.64 rows=9060299 width=91) (actual time=4.993..5.037 rows=3 loops=1)

                       Filter: (claimed_at IS NULL)
   ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.43..25.45 rows=3 width=42) (actual time=5.024..5.083 rows=3 loops=1)

               Index Cond: (id = to_claim.id)
 Planning Time: 0.127 ms
 Execution Time: 5.761 ms
```

However, this still is nowhere near the seconds-long query times suggested by the traces. Thoughts?

Is it possible that a few multi-second long queries per second are normal for this volume of concurrency (assuming they are P95 or P99 in query time)?

**Cursor**

Okay, this is a very insightful update. The emergence of long-held connections in `_check_manual_exclusion` (related to the `domain_metadata` table) is a strong indicator that the issue might be broader than just the `frontier` table or that we have multiple unoptimized queries.

The fact that the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for `_atomic_claim_urls` is still showing execution times in milliseconds (5.7ms, while up from ~1ms, is still very fast) while your logs report connections held for *seconds* is a crucial discrepancy. It strongly suggests that the time is being spent *waiting* for something, rather than in pure query execution. This could be:
1.  **Lock contention:** The query is waiting to acquire necessary locks.
2.  **Connection pool queuing:** The worker is waiting for a connection to become available from the pool *before* it can even execute the query. The current logging in `db_backends.py` measures the time from when the connection is acquired until it's released, so if the query itself is fast, this points more towards the query taking longer than expected, or other operations within that `async with self._get_connection() as conn:` block taking time.
3.  **CPU/IO saturation on the database server:** If the database server is overloaded, all queries will slow down, and wait times will increase.

The new slowdown in `_check_manual_exclusion` needs immediate investigation. This is likely a simpler query, and if it's slow, it points to a missing index or an unexpectedly large table.

**Investigating `_check_manual_exclusion` and `domain_metadata`**

I need to see:
1.  The exact SQL query executed by `_check_manual_exclusion` in `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`.
2.  The schema (CREATE TABLE statement and any indexes) for the `domain_metadata` table, which should be in `crawler/crawler_module/storage.py`.

I'll start by trying to find the relevant code sections.


Okay, I've examined the code and the search results.

**1. `_check_manual_exclusion` in `politeness.py`:**

The relevant queries are:
*   If `self.config.seeded_urls_only` is `True`:
    ```sql
    SELECT is_manually_excluded, is_seeded FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?
    ```
*   If `self.config.seeded_urls_only` is `False`:
    ```sql
    SELECT is_manually_excluded FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?
    ```
In both cases, it's a `SELECT` on the `domain_metadata` table, filtering by the `domain` column.

**2. `domain_metadata` Table Schema:**

From the search results (specifically the `storage.py` snippet), the table is defined as:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS domain_metadata (
    domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    robots_txt_content TEXT,
    robots_txt_fetched_timestamp BIGINT,
    robots_txt_expires_timestamp BIGINT,
    is_manually_excluded INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_seeded INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
```
Critically, `domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY` means that there is **already a primary key index on the `domain` column**. This is good. For PostgreSQL, a primary key constraint automatically creates a unique index. This means the `SELECT ... WHERE domain = ?` queries *should* be very fast, using this index.

**Hypothesis for `_check_manual_exclusion` Slowdown:**

Given that there's an index on `domain`, the slowness of `_check_manual_exclusion` (if it's indeed the query itself and not connection acquisition time) is surprising for a simple primary key lookup. Possible reasons:
1.  **Table Size & Cache Issues:** While `domain_metadata` might not be "bloated" in terms of dead tuples, if it's very large (many unique domains) and frequently accessed, parts of it or its index might not always be hot in PostgreSQL's cache, leading to occasional slower disk I/O. However, this typically doesn't explain multi-second delays for indexed lookups unless I/O is severely constrained.
2.  **Contention/Locking on `domain_metadata`:** Although this query is a `SELECT`, other parts of `PolitenessEnforcer` (e.g., `_update_robots_cache`, `record_domain_fetch_attempt`, `_load_manual_exclusions`) perform `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` or `UPDATE` operations on `domain_metadata`. If these transactions are slow or frequent, they could be holding locks that briefly delay the `SELECT` queries.
3.  **The "Connection held for Xs" measures more than just the query:** As discussed before, the time reported includes the entire `async with self._get_connection() as conn:` block. If the connection pool is exhausted and it takes seconds to *acquire* a connection, that would be included. If the query itself is fast once the connection is obtained, this points to connection pool starvation.

**The 5.7ms `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for `_atomic_claim_urls` vs. Second-Long Logged Times:**

This discrepancy remains the most significant clue. The 5.7ms is for the query *execution*. The seconds-long "connection held" time reported in your logs means that something *within the scope of that database connection being held* is taking a long time.

If the query executes in 5.7ms, but the connection is held for 4 seconds, then ~3.995 seconds are spent either:
*   Waiting to acquire the connection from the pool (if the logging starts *before* true acquisition, but the `traceback.print_stack()` is at the *end* of `_get_connection`'s `__aexit__`, this seems less likely to be the sole cause for the *entire* duration).
*   Lock contention *before* or *during* the query execution that `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` run in isolation doesn't capture. The `LockRows` step in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reflects time spent acquiring row locks, but there could be other locks or contention.
*   Other operations within the `db_backends.py` `execute_returning` or `fetch_one` methods that wrap the raw query execution and are still within the `_get_connection` context. (Unlikely to be significant unless there's heavy data processing client-side, which isn't typical here).

**Revisiting Connection Pool Exhaustion:**

The fact that *two different types of queries* (`_atomic_claim_urls` to `frontier` and `_check_manual_exclusion` to `domain_metadata`) are now showing up with multi-second connection hold times makes connection pool exhaustion a very strong candidate for the *symptom*, if not the root cause.

If even one type of query becomes intermittently slow (perhaps due to table bloat that `VACUUM` didn't fully resolve, or due to contention not visible in isolated `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` runs), it can hold onto connections longer. If enough workers experience this, the pool empties, and then *all* subsequent operations requiring a DB connection (even normally fast ones) will queue up, waiting for a connection. This wait time would be part of the "connection held" duration.

**Next Steps & Recommendations:**

1.  **Confirm `domain_metadata` Index Usage (Sanity Check):**
    Although `PRIMARY KEY` implies an index, you could run an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the politeness query just to be 100% certain it's using the primary key index and is indeed fast in isolation.
    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT is_manually_excluded FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = 'example.com';
    ```
    Replace `'example.com'` with a domain you know is in the table. This should be sub-millisecond.

2.  **Investigate Connection Pool Behavior:**
    *   **What is your connection pool size?** (This is usually configured when `AsyncConnectionPool` or similar is initialized in `db_backends.py` or when the `DatabaseBackend` is set up).
    *   **How many concurrent crawler workers are you running?**
    If the number of workers is significantly greater than the pool size, and if connections are held for even short, unpredictable periods, queuing is inevitable.
    *   **Add Logging for Connection Pool Stats:** If your connection pool library supports it, log statistics like:
        *   Number of active connections
        *   Number of idle connections
        *   Number of pending requests waiting for a connection (queue length)
        This would directly confirm or deny pool exhaustion. `asyncpg`'s pool (if you're using it) has methods like `get_size()`, `get_max_size()`, `get_idle_size()`.

3.  **Tune Autovacuum More Aggressively for `frontier`:**
    You mentioned `frontier` had ~170k dead tuples vs. >9M live tuples. While this ratio (less than 2%) might not seem extreme, for a table with extremely high `UPDATE` churn (like `frontier` doing claims), default autovacuum settings might still not be aggressive enough to keep up optimally. Dead tuples, even if not a huge percentage, can still impact performance over time if they are concentrated in frequently accessed blocks.
    Consider reducing `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` and `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` for the `frontier` table specifically.
    Example (values need careful consideration and testing):
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE frontier SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05); -- Default 0.2
    ALTER TABLE frontier SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02); -- Default 0.1
    ```
    This makes autovacuum trigger more frequently based on a smaller percentage of changed/dead tuples. You'd also want to ensure `autovacuum_max_workers` and other global settings allow for timely processing.

4.  **Isolate the "Slow" `_atomic_claim_urls` Further:**
    The 5.7ms `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is good. The logs showing seconds-long holds for connections used by this query are the problem.
    If it's lock contention *within* PostgreSQL for that query, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` *should* show increased time in the `LockRows` step or other parts of the plan when run under load. The fact that your isolated run doesn't show it means either:
    *   The contention is intermittent and you didn't capture it.
    *   The main delay is indeed waiting for a connection from your application's pool.

    If you suspect internal PG lock contention that `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` isn't fully showing, you might look at `pg_locks` when you see a slowdown:
    ```sql
    SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, page, tuple, virtualxid, transactionid, classid, objid, objsubid, virtualtransaction, pid, mode, granted, fastpath
    FROM pg_locks
    WHERE relation = 'frontier'::regclass;
    ```
    This is more advanced but can show what kind of locks are being held or waited for.

**My Strongest Suspicion Right Now:**

The connection pool is being exhausted due to intermittent slowdowns in DB operations (possibly `_atomic_claim_urls` under specific load/contention scenarios not captured by isolated `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, or other less optimized queries), and this exhaustion then causes even fast queries to appear slow in your logs because they spend a lot of time waiting *for* a connection. The new politeness query warnings are a symptom of this broader pool starvation.

I recommend focusing on monitoring and potentially increasing your connection pool size as a first step, alongside ensuring autovacuum is aggressive enough for `frontier`. Then, if problems persist, dive deeper into capturing `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` *during* a logged slow event or analyzing `pg_locks`.

Could you tell me your current connection pool size and the number of concurrent workers? This will help assess the likelihood of pool exhaustion.Okay, the `domain_metadata` table having `domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY` means indexed lookups on `domain` should indeed be very fast. The slowdown in `_check_manual_exclusion` is therefore also likely a symptom of a broader issue rather than a problem with that specific query's structure.

The fact that `_atomic_claim_urls` executes in 5.7ms in your `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` but connections are logged as held for seconds is the core puzzle. This strongly points towards the time being spent *not* in the query execution itself, but in:
1.  **Waiting for a connection from the pool:** This is now the leading hypothesis. If all connections in the pool are in use (because some operations are holding them longer than expected), new requests will queue up. The "connection held" timer in your logs would include this queueing time.
2.  **Lock contention:** The query might be waiting for locks within PostgreSQL that aren't fully reflected in an isolated `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

The appearance of `_check_manual_exclusion` in the slow logs, despite its efficient underlying query, further strengthens the connection pool exhaustion theory. When the pool is depleted, *any* operation needing a connection will experience delays.

Let's focus on the connection pool and overall database health under load.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Investigate Connection Pool Configuration and Usage:**
    *   What is your **connection pool size** (e.g., `max_connections` or similar setting in your `db_backends.py` or `asyncpg` pool setup)?
    *   How many **concurrent crawler workers** are you running?
    *   I will now try to find where the connection pool is initialized to suggest adding logging for pool statistics. This will give us direct evidence of pool utilization and potential exhaustion.

The search results show the `PostgreSQLBackend` in `crawler/crawler_module/db_backends.py` uses `psycopg_pool.AsyncConnectionPool`. The orchestrator (`crawler/crawler_module/orchestrator.py`) initializes this with:
*   `min_size`: Calculated, often 10.
*   `max_size`: Calculated based on `config.max_workers` (e.g., `max_pool = min(max(int(config.max_workers * 0.3), 20), 80)`), so if you have many workers, it could be up to 80.

The `_get_connection` method in `PostgreSQLBackend` already has some useful logging:
```python
            logger.debug(f"Requesting connection from pool (pool size: {self._pool.get_stats().get('pool_size', 'unknown')})") # This is pool_size, not active connections
            async with self._pool.connection() as conn:
                acquire_time = time.time() - start_time
                if acquire_time > 1.0:
                    logger.warning(f"Slow connection acquisition: {acquire_time:.2f}s")
                logger.debug(f"Connection acquired in {acquire_time:.3f}s")
                yield conn
        finally:
            if conn: # This 'conn' is the connection object, not a boolean indicating if we got one
                hold_time = time.time() - start_time
                logger.debug(f"Connection returned to pool after {hold_time:.3f}s")
                
                if hold_time > CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD:
                    logger.warning(f"Connection held for {hold_time:.3f}s (threshold: {CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD}s)")
                    logger.warning("Stack trace of long-held connection:")
                    traceback.print_stack()
```
This already logs "Slow connection acquisition" if getting a connection from the pool takes > 1 second. Your initial logs showed "Connection held for Xs", which is logged *after* the connection is used and returned. If "Slow connection acquisition" warnings are also present and frequent, that's a direct sign of pool contention.

**Let's enhance the logging in `PostgreSQLBackend._get_connection` to provide more detailed pool statistics at the moment of request.** This will give us a clearer picture of pool health.

I will modify `crawler/crawler_module/db_backends.py` to add more detailed logging to the `_get_connection` method in `PostgreSQLBackend`.


```python
            logger.debug(f"Requesting connection from pool (pool size: {self._pool.get_stats().get('pool_size', 'unknown')})") # This is pool_size, not active connections
            async with self._pool.connection() as conn:
                acquire_time = time.time() - start_time
                if acquire_time > 1.0:
                    logger.warning(f"Slow connection acquisition: {acquire_time:.2f}s")
                logger.debug(f"Connection acquired in {acquire_time:.3f}s")
                yield conn
        finally:
            if conn: # This 'conn' is the connection object, not a boolean indicating if we got one
                hold_time = time.time() - start_time
                logger.debug(f"Connection returned to pool after {hold_time:.3f}s")
                
                if hold_time > CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD:
                    logger.warning(f"Connection held for {hold_time:.3f}s (threshold: {CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD}s)")
                    logger.warning("Stack trace of long-held connection:")
                    traceback.print_stack()
```

```python
            logger.debug(f"Requesting connection from pool (pool size: {self._pool.get_stats().get('pool_size', 'unknown')})") # This is pool_size, not active connections
            async with self._pool.connection() as conn:
                acquire_time = time.time() - start_time
                if acquire_time > 1.0:
                    logger.warning(f"Slow connection acquisition: {acquire_time:.2f}s")
                logger.debug(f"Connection acquired in {acquire_time:.3f}s")
                yield conn
        finally:
            if conn: # This 'conn' is the connection object, not a boolean indicating if we got one
                hold_time = time.time() - start_time
                logger.debug(f"Connection returned to pool after {hold_time:.3f}s")
                
                if hold_time > CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD:
                    logger.warning(f"Connection held for {hold_time:.3f}s (threshold: {CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD}s)")
                    logger.warning("Stack trace of long-held connection:")
                    traceback.print_stack()
```

```python
\
// ... existing code ...
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def _get_connection(self):
        \"\"\"Get a connection from the pool (context manager).\"\"\"
        if not self._pool:
            raise RuntimeError("PostgreSQL pool not initialized")
        
        conn = None
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            # More detailed pool stats logging
            stats = self._pool.get_stats()
            pool_min = stats.get('min_size', 'N/A')
            pool_max = stats.get('max_size', 'N/A')
            pool_used = stats.get('used_conns', 'N/A') # Or 'pool_size' - 'idle_conns' if 'used_conns' isn't available
            pool_idle = stats.get('idle_conns', 'N/A')
            pool_queued = stats.get('pending_requests', 'N/A') # Check psycopg_pool docs for correct key
            
            logger.debug(
                f"Requesting connection. Pool stats: min={pool_min}, max={pool_max}, "
                f"used={pool_used}, idle={pool_idle}, queued={pool_queued}"
            )
            
            async with self._pool.connection() as conn:
                acquire_time = time.time() - start_time
                if acquire_time > 1.0:
// ... existing code ...

```

The edit seems to have been applied correctly, adding more detailed logging.

**Important Note on `psycopg_pool` Stats:**
I've used common names for pool statistics like `used_conns`, `idle_conns`, and `pending_requests`. You might need to consult the `psycopg_pool` (version 3.x) documentation or inspect the `self._pool.get_stats()` dictionary output during a run to confirm the exact keys for:
*   Currently active/used connections.
*   Currently idle connections in the pool.
*   Number of requests currently waiting for a connection (if available).

The `psycopg_pool.AsyncConnectionPool.get_stats()` method returns a dictionary. Common keys include:
`pool_size`: current number of connections in the pool (idle + active).
`min_size`, `max_size`: configuration.
`free_conns`: (Older versions) or `idle_conns` might represent idle connections.
`used_conns`: might represent active connections.
`pending`: (or similar) might represent queued requests.

If the exact keys I used (`used_conns`, `idle_conns`, `pending_requests`) are not correct, the log output for those specific stats will show 'N/A'. You can adjust the `edit_file` call with the correct keys once you've identified them from the `psycopg_pool` documentation or by printing `stats` itself.

**After this change, please re-run your crawler.**

**When the slowdown occurs, look for these patterns in your logs:**
1.  **"Slow connection acquisition" warnings:** These are now more critical. If they appear frequently, it's a strong sign of pool exhaustion.
2.  **The new "Requesting connection. Pool stats..." logs:**
    *   Pay close attention to `used=` and `idle=`. If `idle=` is consistently 0 or very low, and `used=` is at or near `max=`, the pool is saturated.
    *   If `queued=` (or its equivalent) is consistently greater than 0, it means requests are actively waiting, which will directly contribute to the "connection held" time.
3.  **Correlate with "Connection held for Xs" warnings:** See if the long hold times correspond to periods of high pool utilization or queuing indicated by the new logs.

**Further Actions Based on New Log Output:**

*   **If Pool Exhaustion is Confirmed:**
    *   **Increase `max_size`:** This is the most direct solution if the database server can handle more connections. Your current calculation for `max_pool` (up to 80, trying to reserve 20 for a PostgreSQL default of 100) is reasonable, but if your PostgreSQL `max_connections` is higher, or if the 30% concurrent DB access estimate is too low, you might have room to increase it.
    *   **Optimize Queries Further:** Even if queries are fast in isolation, under high concurrency, any slight inefficiency can contribute to connections being held longer, leading to pool exhaustion. This is a continuous process.
    *   **Reduce Number of Workers:** If the DB cannot handle the load or more connections, you might need to reduce `config.max_workers`.
    *   **Review `CONNECTION_HOLD_THRESHOLD`:** The current 2.0s is a good threshold for warnings.

*   **If Pool Does Not Seem Exhausted, but "Connection held" warnings persist:**
    *   This would imply that the time is being spent due to locking or other database-internal delays that aren't just about query execution speed but about waiting for resources *within* a query or transaction. This makes `pg_locks` analysis and capturing `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` *during* a slow event more critical.
    *   Check PostgreSQL server-side logs for any errors, warnings, or slow query logs that it might be generating.

Let me know what the new logs reveal. This should give us much clearer insight into the connection pooling dynamics.

**User**

Oh hmm, I was confused why you were talking about wait times when I was flagging long "connection held" times, but I re-read the logging code and realized the `hold_time` measures total time since the connection was requested, not time that the connection was held. I just fixed that. After re-running the crawler a bit, traces from the politeness query no longer show up, but the atomic_claim_urls query still shows up.

---

**Cursor**

That's an excellent and crucial correction to the logging! Understanding that `hold_time` now accurately measures the time the connection is actively used (after acquisition) changes the picture significantly.

Here's what this implies:

1.  **Politeness Queries are Fine:** The fact that `_check_manual_exclusion` (politeness query) traces no longer show up with long hold times means those queries are indeed executing quickly once they have a connection. The previous long logged times for them were almost certainly due to waiting for a connection from an exhausted pool. Your fix has confirmed this.

2.  **`_atomic_claim_urls` is the Culprit for Active Long Holds:** The persistence of long "Connection held for Xs" traces specifically for `_atomic_claim_urls` now strongly indicates that the query *itself*, or operations tightly coupled with its execution within the `PostgreSQLBackend.execute_returning` method's `async with self._get_connection() as conn:` block, is what's taking seconds.

This brings the ~5.7ms `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for `_atomic_claim_urls` into sharp focus. If the query truly executes that fast, but the connection (now measuring active use) is held for seconds, there's a discrepancy. However, it's more likely that the 5.7ms `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` was run under conditions (e.g., low load, warm cache, immediately after `VACUUM ANALYZE`) where the query performed optimally, and under sustained high load, its performance degrades.

**The core issue now is to figure out why the `_atomic_claim_urls` query is sometimes taking seconds to execute.**

Possible reasons for this include:

*   **Lock Contention:** Even with `SKIP LOCKED`, if many workers are contending for the same small set of available rows (e.g., if the rate of adding new URLs is slower than the rate of claiming), there could be increased contention or retries at a higher level, or the process of finding and locking rows takes longer. The `LockRows` part of an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` *during a slow period* would be revealing.
*   **I/O Bottlenecks:** Under heavy load, if the `frontier` table and its `idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time` index (or parts of them) are not consistently in PostgreSQL's cache, disk I/O could become a significant factor, especially if the table is large and fragmented despite VACUUM.
*   **CPU Saturation on DB Server:** If many workers are running this and other queries, the database server's CPU could be a bottleneck.
*   **Suboptimal Plan Under Certain Conditions:** While the index is good, it's possible that under specific data distributions or statistics staleness that occurs after hours of crawling, the planner's estimates are off, leading to a less efficient execution path than seen in your isolated `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

**Next Diagnostic Steps:**

The most direct way to understand what's happening *on the PostgreSQL server* when these slowdowns occur is to inspect its activity and wait events.

1.  **Inspect `pg_stat_activity` During Slowdowns:**
    When you observe the crawler slowing down and see the "Connection held for Xs" warnings for `_atomic_claim_urls`, please connect to your PostgreSQL database and run the following query multiple times:
    ```sql
    SELECT
        pid,
        datname,
        usename,
        application_name,
        client_addr,
        backend_start,
        xact_start,
        query_start,
        state_change,
        wait_event_type,
        wait_event,
        state,
        query
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE state <> 'idle' AND query ILIKE '%FROM frontier %' -- To catch the _atomic_claim_urls CTE
    ORDER BY query_start ASC;
    ```
    Look for:
    *   **`state`**: Is it `active` (running), or is it stuck in another state?
    *   **`wait_event_type` and `wait_event`**: This is crucial.
        *   If `wait_event_type` is `Lock`, it indicates locking contention.
        *   If `wait_event_type` is `IO`, it indicates time spent waiting for disk. (Events like `DataFileRead`, `WALWrite`).
        *   If `wait_event_type` is `CPU` (less common to see directly as a wait, but look for generally high CPU usage on the DB server).
        *   Other types like `Client` (waiting to send data to client), `IPC`, `Timeout`.
    This will tell you what those specific PostgreSQL backends servicing your `_atomic_claim_urls` queries are actually waiting on when they are slow.

2.  **Check PostgreSQL Slow Query Log:**
    Do you have PostgreSQL's own slow query logging enabled? This is controlled by settings in `postgresql.conf`, primarily:
    *   `log_min_duration_statement`: If this is set to a value (e.g., `200ms` or `1s`), PostgreSQL will log any query that exceeds this execution time.
    *   `log_statement = 'ddl'` or `'mod'` or `'all'` can also be relevant.
    If enabled, the PostgreSQL logs would contain the actual queries that were slow from the server's perspective, often with their execution times and sometimes even the query plan if `auto_explain` module is configured.

Please try to capture the `pg_stat_activity` output when you next observe the issue. The `wait_event_type` and `wait_event` for the problematic queries will be very informative. Let me know also if you have PostgreSQL's slow query logging active.

```sql
    SELECT
        pid,
        datname,
        usename,
        application_name,
        client_addr,
        backend_start,
        xact_start,
        query_start,
        state_change,
        wait_event_type,
        wait_event,
        state,
        query
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE state <> 'idle' AND query ILIKE '%FROM frontier %' -- To catch the _atomic_claim_urls CTE
    ORDER BY query_start ASC;
```
