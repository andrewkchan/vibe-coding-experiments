# Resuming Web Crawler Unit Test Fixes
_Exported on 5/25/2025 at 01:55:59 PDT from Cursor (0.50.5)_

**User**

We are resuming a programming project in the folder `crawler` whose context got too long and had to be summarized and restarted in this chat. In that folder, please find in `PROMPT.md` the original prompt (building a web crawler) + goals/non-goals, the plan that you came up with in `PLAN.MD` (including important addendum), and the summary of the entire previous session in `CHAT.MD`.

We will resume fixing the unit tests that you wrote which have many failures. The latest output of `pytest` is attached. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the codebase.

Let me know when you are ready to proceed with fixing the first failing unit test.

**Cursor**

Okay, I've reviewed the project materials (`PROMPT.MD`, `PLAN.MD`, `CHAT.MD`) and the `pytest` output. I have a good understanding of the project goals, the current architecture, the implementation progress, and the specific test failures we need to address.

It looks like the main issues are:
1.  Several `NameError: name 'AsyncMock' is not defined` in `tests/test_politeness.py`. This indicates a missing import.
2.  Various `AssertionError` instances in `tests/test_politeness.py`, mostly related to incorrect mock call counts or unexpected return values. This points to potential logic changes in the `PolitenessEnforcer` or issues with how the tests are mocking dependencies and verifying state, especially around database interactions.
3.  `AssertionError` failures in `tests/test_utils.py` concerning URL normalization (trailing slashes, scheme case) and domain extraction from non-HTTP(S) URLs.

I'm ready to start fixing the first set of failing unit tests. Let's begin with the `NameError: name 'AsyncMock' is not defined` in `tests/test_politeness.py`. This should be a relatively straightforward fix by adding the necessary import.

I will now read the `tests/test_politeness.py` file to confirm the missing import and then apply the fix.

Ah, it seems I made a mistake with the file path. The correct path should be `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`.

I'll read the correct file now.

You are correct, the file `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` uses `AsyncMock` in several places (e.g., lines 392, 405, 415, etc.) without importing it.

I will add `from unittest.mock import AsyncMock` to the import statements at the beginning of the file.

```python
import pytest
import pytest_asyncio
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
import time
import sqlite3
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, mock_open, patch, AsyncMock

// ... existing code ...
```

The import for `AsyncMock` has been successfully added. This should resolve the `NameError` failures.

Next, we should tackle the `AssertionError` instances in `tests/test_politeness.py`. Based on the test summary, these seem to be the most numerous.

Let's start with `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success - assert 0 > 0`.
This assertion `assert len(update_calls) > 0` is failing, meaning `update_calls` is empty. This list comprehension `[call for call in mock_cursor.execute.call_args_list if "UPDATE domain_metadata" in call[0][0]]` is intended to find "UPDATE domain_metadata" calls.

It's possible that the mock setup for `mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = (stale_robots_text, past_expiry)` which simulates a stale cache entry isn't working as expected with the threaded database access, or that the subsequent fetch and update logic has a bug.

To investigate this, I need to see the `PolitenessEnforcer._get_robots_for_domain` method and how it interacts with the database, especially how it's calling `sqlite3.connect` and executing queries in a separate thread.

My apologies, another incorrect file path. I'll use the correct one: `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`.

Okay, I've examined the `_get_robots_for_domain` method in `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`.

The key part for the failing test `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success` is how the database interaction is mocked when using `asyncio.to_thread`. The test currently mocks `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value` (let's call this `mock_cursor`). This `mock_cursor` is what the *main thread's* `StorageManager` instance would use if it were performing synchronous DB operations.

However, `_get_robots_for_domain` calls `_db_get_cached_robots_sync_threaded` and `_db_update_robots_cache_sync_threaded` using `asyncio.to_thread`. These threaded functions establish *their own* `sqlite3.connect` and `cursor` instances. The mock setup in the test for `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor` will not affect these new connections/cursors created within the threads.

This is why `mock_cursor.execute.call_args_list` is empty in the test assertion: the `execute` calls are happening on a *different cursor object* inside the thread.

To fix this, the test `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success` (and likely others that mock DB interactions for threaded functions) needs to patch `sqlite3.connect` itself, so that when the threaded function calls `sqlite3.connect(db_path, ...)`, it receives a mock connection, and from that, a mock cursor that we can inspect.

The test `test_get_robots_from_db_cache_fresh` already does something similar:
```python
    with patch('sqlite3.connect', return_value=mock_db_conn_instance) as mock_sqlite_connect:
        rerp = await politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain(domain)
        # ... assertions on mock_db_cursor_instance ...
```

We need to apply a similar patching strategy to `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success`.

Here's the plan:
1.  Modify `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success` in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`.
2.  Instead of mocking `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor`, we will `patch('sqlite3.connect')`.
3.  The mocked `sqlite3.connect` will return a `mock_db_conn_instance`.
4.  This `mock_db_conn_instance.cursor()` will return a `mock_db_cursor_instance`.
5.  We'll set up `mock_db_cursor_instance.fetchone.return_value` to simulate the stale cache entry.
6.  After `await politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain(domain)` is called, we will assert on `mock_db_cursor_instance.execute.call_args_list` for the `UPDATE` statement.

Let's apply this.

```python
    with patch('sqlite3.connect', return_value=mock_db_conn_instance) as mock_sqlite_connect:
        rerp = await politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain(domain)
        # ... assertions on mock_db_cursor_instance ...
```

```python

    # Ensure commit was called on the connection instance used by the update thread
    mock_db_conn_instance.commit.assert_called_once()
    assert domain in politeness_enforcer.robots_parsers


@pytest.mark.asyncio
// ... existing code ...

```

The test `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success` has been refactored to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`. This should now correctly mock the database interactions happening within the separate thread and allow us to assert the expected `UPDATE` call.

The next errors in the `pytest` output for `test_politeness.py` are:
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success - assert 0 > 0`
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success - assert 0 > 0`
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_all_fetches_fail_connection_error - assert 0 > 0`

These tests also seem to be failing on assertions like `assert len(update_calls) > 0`, which implies the `mock_cursor.execute.call_args_list` is not capturing the `UPDATE domain_metadata` calls. This is the same pattern we just addressed.

These tests (`test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success`, `test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success`, `test_get_robots_all_fetches_fail_connection_error`) are likely suffering from the same issue: they mock `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor` but the actual database calls in `_get_robots_for_domain` (specifically `_db_update_robots_cache_sync_threaded`) happen in a thread with a new connection.

I'll apply the same `patch('sqlite3.connect')` strategy to these three tests.

```

The tests `test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success`, `test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success`, and `test_get_robots_all_fetches_fail_connection_error` in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` have been refactored to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`. I also noticed the apply model correctly escaped `\n` to `\\n` in the `robots_text` strings within the edit, which is good.

This should resolve the `assert 0 > 0` errors for these tests by ensuring the database update calls within the threaded functions are properly mocked and inspectable.

The next failing test according to the summary is `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_http_404_https_404 - AssertionError: assert 1 == 2`.
This test was also part of the batch I just refactored. The assertion failing is `assert politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.call_count == 2`.

Let's re-examine the logic in `_get_robots_for_domain` for the 404 case:
```python
            # ...
            fetch_result_http: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_http, is_robots_txt=True)

            if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_http.text_content is not None:
                robots_content = fetch_result_http.text_content
            elif fetch_result_http.status_code == 404: # First 404
                logger.debug(f\"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTP for {domain}. Assuming allow all.\")
                robots_content = \"\" # Sets content, but doesn't stop trying HTTPS
            # ----> Issue: Even if HTTP is 404, it proceeds to try HTTPS <----
            else: 
                logger.info(f\"HTTP fetch for robots.txt failed for {domain} (status: {fetch_result_http.status_code}). Trying HTTPS.\")
                fetch_result_https: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_https, is_robots_txt=True)
                if fetch_result_https.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_https.text_content is not None:
                    robots_content = fetch_result_https.text_content
                elif fetch_result_https.status_code == 404: # Second 404
                    logger.debug(f\"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTPS for {domain}. Assuming allow all.\")
                    robots_content = \"\"
                else:
                    # ...
```
The current logic in `_get_robots_for_domain` is:
1. Try HTTP.
2. If HTTP status is 200, use content.
3. If HTTP status is 404, set `robots_content = ""` **but then it falls through to the `else` block which tries HTTPS.**
4. If HTTP status is anything else (not 200, not 404), then it tries HTTPS.

The test `test_get_robots_http_404_https_404` simulates both HTTP and HTTPS fetches returning a 404.
`politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.side_effect = [fetch_result_404, fetch_result_404]`
So, `fetch_url` *is* called twice, which matches the assertion `assert politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.call_count == 2`.

The test assertion `assert 1 == 2` is from the `pytest` summary, but the actual assertion in the code (which I just refactored in the previous step) is:
`assert politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.call_count == 2`
And the mock setup is:
`politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.side_effect = [fetch_result_404, fetch_result_404]`

This means `fetch_url` *should* be called twice. The test summary (`assert 1 == 2`) might be outdated or misinterpreting the failure. If the `call_count` is indeed 1, it would mean that after the HTTP 404, the code is not proceeding to the HTTPS fetch, which contradicts my reading of the `_get_robots_for_domain` logic.

Let's look at the `PolitenessEnforcer._get_robots_for_domain` again carefully.

```python
            # ...
            fetch_result_http: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_http, is_robots_txt=True)

            if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_http.text_content is not None:
                robots_content = fetch_result_http.text_content
            elif fetch_result_http.status_code == 404: # HTTP is 404
                logger.debug(f"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTP for {domain}. Assuming allow all.")
                robots_content = "" 
                # After this, it does NOT go into the 'else' immediately below.
                # The 'else' is tied to the 'if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200'.
                # So, if HTTP is 404, robots_content becomes "", and then it will try HTTPS
                # because the next part of the code is not guarded against robots_content already being set.
                # This means if HTTP is 404, it WILL try HTTPS.

            # The problem might be here:
            # This 'else' is connected to the 'if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200'.
            # It is NOT an 'else' for the 'elif fetch_result_http.status_code == 404'.
            else: # This block is entered if status_code != 200 AND status_code != 404 for HTTP
                logger.info(f"HTTP fetch for robots.txt failed for {domain} (status: {fetch_result_http.status_code}). Trying HTTPS.")
                fetch_result_https: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_https, is_robots_txt=True)
                # ... logic for HTTPS result ...
```

Ah, I see the structural issue in `_get_robots_for_domain` that could cause `fetch_url` to be called only once if the first call results in a 404:

```python
            # ...
            if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_http.text_content is not None:
                robots_content = fetch_result_http.text_content
            elif fetch_result_http.status_code == 404:
                logger.debug(f"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTP for {domain}. Assuming allow all.")
                robots_content = "" # <--- HTTPS attempt is SKIPPED if HTTP is 404
            else: # Only if HTTP is not 200 AND not 404
                logger.info(f"HTTP fetch for robots.txt failed for {domain} (status: {fetch_result_http.status_code}). Trying HTTPS.")
                fetch_result_https: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_https, is_robots_txt=True)
                # ... (process https result) ...
```
If `fetch_result_http.status_code == 404`, `robots_content` is set to `""`, and then the `else` block (which contains the HTTPS fetch) is skipped. This means `fetch_url` would only be called once. This would explain `fetch_url.call_count == 1`, leading to `assert 1 == 2` failing.

The desired logic is: if HTTP fails (any non-200 status), try HTTPS. A 404 is a failure in terms of getting rules, so we *should* try HTTPS.

The fix is to restructure the `if/elif/else` for fetching:

```python
            # Desired logic:
            # 1. Try HTTP.
            # 2. If HTTP gives 200, use its content.
            # 3. If HTTP gives anything else (404, 500, etc.), then try HTTPS.
            # 4. If HTTPS gives 200, use its content.
            # 5. If HTTPS also fails (e.g. 404), then default to empty/allow.

            robots_content_found = False
            if fetch_result_http.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_http.text_content is not None:
                robots_content = fetch_result_http.text_content
                robots_content_found = True
            # Removed the elif for 404 here to ensure HTTPS is tried unless HTTP is 200.
            
            if not robots_content_found: # If HTTP didn't succeed with 200
                if fetch_result_http.status_code == 404:
                    logger.debug(f"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTP for {domain}. Trying HTTPS.")
                else: # Other HTTP errors
                    logger.info(f"HTTP fetch for robots.txt failed for {domain} (status: {fetch_result_http.status_code}). Trying HTTPS.")

                fetch_result_https: FetchResult = await self.fetcher.fetch_url(robots_url_https, is_robots_txt=True)
                if fetch_result_https.status_code == 200 and fetch_result_https.text_content is not None:
                    robots_content = fetch_result_https.text_content
                elif fetch_result_https.status_code == 404:
                    logger.debug(f"robots.txt not found (404) via HTTPS for {domain}. Assuming allow all.")
                    robots_content = ""
                else:
                    logger.warning(f"Failed to fetch robots.txt for {domain} via HTTPS as well (status: {fetch_result_https.status_code}). Assuming allow all.")
                    robots_content = ""
            
            # Ensure robots_content has a value before proceeding to DB update
            if robots_content is None: # Should only happen if HTTP was 200 but text_content was None (unlikely for this logic)
                 logger.warning(f"Robots content was unexpectedly None for {domain} after fetch attempts. Defaulting to allow.")
                 robots_content = ""
```
This revised structure ensures that if the HTTP attempt is not a success (status 200 with content), it *always* proceeds to try the HTTPS URL. This means `fetch_url` will be called twice if the first call is a 404, which should satisfy the test's expectation.

I'll apply this logic change to `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`.

            else:

```

The `_get_robots_for_domain` method in `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py` has been updated with the new fetching logic. This change ensures that an HTTPS fetch is attempted if the initial HTTP fetch does not return a status 200 with content. This should fix the `AssertionError: assert 1 == 2` (which actually means `assert fetcher.call_count == 2` was failing because `call_count` was 1) in `test_get_robots_http_404_https_404`.

The next failing test is `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_is_url_allowed_manually_excluded - assert True is False`.
This test checks if `is_url_allowed` correctly returns `False` for a domain that is marked as manually excluded in the database. The failure `assert True is False` means `is_url_allowed` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

Let's look at the relevant parts of `is_url_allowed`:
```python
    async def is_url_allowed(self, url: str) -> bool:
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        domain = extract_domain(url)
        # ...
        # 1. Check manual exclusion first (DB access in thread)
        try:
            def _db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded():
                with sqlite3.connect(db_path, timeout=10) as conn_threaded:
                    cursor = conn_threaded.cursor()
                    try:
                        cursor.execute("SELECT is_manually_excluded FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,))
                        return cursor.fetchone()
                    finally:
                        cursor.close()
            row = await asyncio.to_thread(_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded)
            if row and row[0] == 1: # row[0] is is_manually_excluded
                logger.debug(f"URL {url} from manually excluded domain: {domain}")
                return False # Correctly returns False if excluded
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            logger.warning(f"DB error checking manual exclusion for {domain}: {e}")
            # If DB error, it falls through, potentially returning True later. This might be an issue.

        # 2. Check robots.txt ...
        # ...
        return True # Default if no other rule disallows
```
The logic for checking `is_manually_excluded` seems correct: it queries the database and if `row[0] == 1`, it returns `False`.

Now let's look at the test `test_is_url_allowed_manually_excluded`:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_is_url_allowed_manually_excluded(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "manualexclude.com"
    url = f"http://{domain}/somepage"
    
    mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
    # Simulate domain is manually excluded in DB
    mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = (1,) # is_manually_excluded = 1

    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(url) is False
    # Ensure _get_robots_for_domain is NOT called if manually excluded
    politeness_enforcer.fetcher.fetch_url.assert_not_called()

This test suffers from the *exact same mocking problem* we've been fixing. It mocks `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor`, but `is_url_allowed` calls `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded` using `asyncio.to_thread`, which creates its own database connection and cursor. So, the `mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = (1,)` is never seen by the actual code path.

The fix is to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')` for this test as well.

I will apply this fix to `test_is_url_allowed_manually_excluded`.

```python
    async def is_url_allowed(self, url: str) -> bool:
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        domain = extract_domain(url)
        # ...
        # 1. Check manual exclusion first (DB access in thread)
        try:
            def _db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded():
                with sqlite3.connect(db_path, timeout=10) as conn_threaded:
                    cursor = conn_threaded.cursor()
                    try:
                        cursor.execute("SELECT is_manually_excluded FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,))
                        return cursor.fetchone()
                    finally:
                        cursor.close()
            row = await asyncio.to_thread(_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded)

The test `test_is_url_allowed_manually_excluded` has been updated to correctly mock the threaded database call. This should resolve the `assert True is False` failure.

The next set of failures from the `pytest` summary are:
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_new_domain - AssertionError: assert 0 == 2`
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_existing_domain - AssertionError: assert 0 == 2`

Both of these tests are failing with `AssertionError: assert 0 == 2`. The assertion in both tests is `assert mock_cursor.execute.call_count == 2`. This is checking the number of SQL `execute` calls made by the `record_domain_fetch_attempt` method.

Let's look at `record_domain_fetch_attempt`:
```python
    async def record_domain_fetch_attempt(self, domain: str):
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        # Removed 'if not self.storage.conn:' check as it's not robust for threaded access
        # The threaded function will establish its own connection.
        try:
            current_time = int(time.time())
            def _db_record_fetch_sync_threaded():
                # This connection is local to the thread
                with sqlite3.connect(db_path, timeout=10) as conn_threaded:
                    cursor = conn_threaded.cursor()
                    try:
                        # Call 1: INSERT OR IGNORE
                        cursor.execute("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO domain_metadata (domain, last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp) VALUES (?,?)", 
                                       (domain, current_time))
                        # Call 2: UPDATE
                        cursor.execute("UPDATE domain_metadata SET last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp = ? WHERE domain = ?", 
                                       (current_time, domain))
                        conn_threaded.commit()
                    finally:
                        cursor.close() # Ensures cursor is closed even if commit fails
            await asyncio.to_thread(_db_record_fetch_sync_threaded)
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            logger.error(f"DB error recording fetch attempt for {domain}: {e}")
```
This method makes exactly two `cursor.execute` calls inside `_db_record_fetch_sync_threaded`.

Now, the tests:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_new_domain(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "recordnew.com"
    mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
    
    await politeness_enforcer.record_domain_fetch_attempt(domain)

    assert mock_cursor.execute.call_count == 2 # <--- Fails (0 == 2)
    # ... other assertions ...

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_existing_domain(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "recordexisting.com"
    mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
    
    await politeness_enforcer.record_domain_fetch_attempt(domain)

    assert mock_cursor.execute.call_count == 2 # <--- Fails (0 == 2)
    # ... other assertions ...
```
Once again, these tests are trying to inspect a `mock_cursor` derived from `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn`, but the actual database operations occur in `_db_record_fetch_sync_threaded` using `asyncio.to_thread`, which establishes its own connection and cursor. The `mock_cursor` in the test is never used by the code under test.

The solution is the same: refactor these two tests to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')` to mock the connection and cursor created within the thread.

I will apply this fix.

```python
    async def record_domain_fetch_attempt(self, domain: str):
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        # Removed 'if not self.storage.conn:' check as it's not robust for threaded access
        # The threaded function will establish its own connection.
        try:
            current_time = int(time.time())
            def _db_record_fetch_sync_threaded():
                # This connection is local to the thread
                with sqlite3.connect(db_path, timeout=10) as conn_threaded:
                    cursor = conn_threaded.cursor()
                    try:
                        # Call 1: INSERT OR IGNORE
                        cursor.execute("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO domain_metadata (domain, last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp) VALUES (?,?)", 
                                       (domain, current_time))

                        cursor.execute("UPDATE domain_metadata SET last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp = ? WHERE domain = ?", 
                                       (current_time, domain))
                        conn_threaded.commit()

The tests `test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_new_domain` and `test_record_domain_fetch_attempt_existing_domain` have been refactored to correctly mock the threaded database calls using `patch('sqlite3.connect')`. The assertions now check the `call_count` and the specific SQL queries (with `pytest.approx` for timestamps) on the correctly mocked cursor, and also verify that `commit()` is called on the mocked connection. This should resolve the `assert 0 == 2` failures.

We have now addressed all the `AssertionError` failures in `tests/test_politeness.py` that were related to incorrect mocking of threaded database operations. The remaining `AssertionError`s in `test_utils.py` and the `NameError`s we fixed earlier should mean a significant portion of the test failures are resolved.

It would be good to run `pytest` again at this point to see the current state of test failures. However, I don't have the capability to directly trigger a test run.

Assuming the fixes for `test_politeness.py` are effective, let's look at the failures in `tests/test_utils.py` from the provided summary:
*   `FAILED tests/test_utils.py::test_normalize_url[https://example.com:80/-https://example.com:80] - AssertionError: assert 'https://example.com:80/' == 'https://example.com:80'`
*   `FAILED tests/test_utils.py::test_normalize_url[http://example.com:443/-http://example.com:443] - AssertionError: assert 'http://example.com:443/' == 'http://example.com:443'`
*   `FAILED tests/test_utils.py::test_normalize_url[HTTP://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM/another_path?param=1&PARAM=2-http://www.example.com/another_path?param=1&PARAM=2] - AssertionError: assert 'http://http:...ram=1&PARAM=2' == 'http://www.e...ram=1&PARAM=2'` (This one looks like a truncation in the error message, but likely scheme/hostname case).
*   `FAILED tests/test_utils.py::test_normalize_url[http://example.com/-http://example.com] - AssertionError: assert 'http://example.com/' == 'http://example.com'`
*   `FAILED tests/test_utils.py::test_extract_domain[ftp://another.example.org-example.org] - AssertionError: assert None == 'example.org'`

The `test_normalize_url` failures seem to revolve around:
1.  Trailing slashes: The tests expect URLs like `https://example.com:80/` to be normalized to `https://example.com:80` (i.e., trailing slash removed if the path is otherwise empty).
2.  Scheme/hostname case: `HTTP://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM` should become `http://www.example.com`.

The `test_extract_domain` failure indicates that `extract_domain("ftp://another.example.org")` is returning `None` when it's expected to return `'example.org'`. This suggests the `tldextract` library might not be handling FTP schemes as expected, or our wrapper around it has a bug.

Let's start by examining the `normalize_url` function in `crawler/crawler_module/utils.py`.

Looking at `normalize_url` in `crawler/crawler_module/utils.py`:

1.  **Scheme/Hostname Case**:
    ```python
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower()
    netloc = parsed.netloc.lower()
    ```
    This correctly lowercases the scheme and netloc, so `HTTP://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM` should become `http://www.example.com`. The test failure `assert 'http://http:...ram=1&PARAM=2' == 'http://www.e...ram=1&PARAM=2'` might be due to the `url.strip()` and the initial `if not url.startswith(...) url = "http://" + url` logic interacting poorly with an already-schemed URL if the scheme isn't lowercase initially. For example, if `url` is `HTTP://...`, `startswith` would be false.
    A better approach for default scheme is to parse first, then check `parsed.scheme`.

2.  **Trailing Slashes**:
    ```python
    # Remove trailing slash unless it's the only thing in the path
    if normalized.endswith("/") and len(urlparse(normalized).path) > 1:
        normalized = normalized.rstrip("/")
    ```
    The tests expect `http://example.com/` to become `http://example.com`.
    `urlparse("http://example.com/").path` is `"/"`. So `len(...)` is 1.
    The condition `len(urlparse(normalized).path) > 1` means that for a URL like `http://example.com/`, the trailing slash will *not* be removed. This is the opposite of what the failing tests expect (`assert 'http://example.com/' == 'http://example.com'`).
    The condition should probably be `if normalized.endswith("/") and urlparse(normalized).path != "/":` or simply remove it if the path is just `/` and we want `http://example.com` from `http://example.com/`. If the goal is for `http://example.com/` to become `http://example.com`, the logic should be: if path is `/`, change path to `""` (empty string for `urlunparse`).

Let's refine `normalize_url`.

**Proposed changes for `normalize_url`:**
1.  Parse the URL *before* attempting to prepend a default scheme. This way, we use the existing scheme if present, and only add `http://` if no scheme is found.
2.  Adjust the trailing slash logic: If the path is exactly `/`, it should be stripped to make `http://example.com/` become `http://example.com`. For paths like `/foo/`, it should become `/foo`.

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse, urldefrag # keep existing
import tldextract

def normalize_url(url: str) -> str:
    url = url.strip()
    
    # If no scheme, add http by default.
    # Better to parse first, then check scheme.
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower()
    netloc = parsed.netloc.lower()
    path = parsed.path
    query = parsed.query
    # fragment is removed later by urldefrag

    if not scheme: # Add default scheme if missing
        scheme = "http"
        # Re-parse if we added a scheme to a URL that might have been just "example.com/path"
        # No, if scheme was missing, netloc and path might be misparsed.
        # Let's reconstruct and re-parse if we have to add a scheme to a schemeless URL.
        if "://" not in url: # Simple check if it was truly schemeless
             url_with_scheme = "http://" + url
             parsed = urlparse(url_with_scheme)
             scheme = parsed.scheme.lower() # Should be 'http'
             netloc = parsed.netloc.lower()
             path = parsed.path
             query = parsed.query


    # Lowercase scheme and hostname (already done if re-parsed)
    scheme = scheme.lower()
    netloc = netloc.lower()
    
    # Remove default port (80 for http, 443 for https)
    if (scheme == "http" and netloc.endswith(":80")) or \
       (scheme == "https" and netloc.endswith(":443")):
        netloc = netloc.rsplit(":", 1)[0]
        
    # Remove fragment from path component. Path itself is taken from parsed.
    # urldefrag returns (url_without_fragment, fragment). We only want the path part.
    # path_without_fragment = urldefrag(path).url # This is wrong if path has no fragment
    
    # Let's handle path and fragment carefully.
    # urlunparse takes (scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment)
    # We want to remove the fragment from the *original* URL's fragment part.
    # The `path` variable currently holds the path. We should use an empty fragment.
    
    # Normalize path: remove multiple slashes, dot segments (e.g. /./, /../)
    # urllib.parse doesn't have a built-in robust path normalizer like this.
    # For now, we'll focus on the trailing slash and scheme/host.
    # A more complex normalization would involve os.path.normpath on the path component,
    # but that's for filesystem paths. For URLs, it's more nuanced.
    # Let's stick to what the tests cover first.

    # Trailing slash removal:
    # If path is '/' it should become '' for urlunparse to produce 'http://example.com'
    # If path is '/foo/' it should become '/foo'
    if path.endswith("/") and path != "/":
        path = path.rstrip("/")
    elif path == "/": # For "http://example.com/" -> "http://example.com"
        path = "" # urlunparse with empty path and non-empty netloc gives no slash.

    # Reconstruct URL
    # Params are usually empty for web URLs we care about.
    normalized = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, path, '', query, '')) # Empty fragment
        
    return normalized
```

This is getting a bit complex trying to handle the "add scheme then re-parse" idea correctly. A simpler initial parse and then conditional prefixing if the scheme is missing might be better.

Let's try a slightly cleaner approach for `normalize_url`:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse, urldefrag
import tldextract

def normalize_url(url: str) -> str:
    url = url.strip()
    
    # Prepend http:// if no scheme is present to allow urlparse to work correctly
    # for inputs like "example.com/path"
    original_url_had_scheme = "://" in url.split("?", 1)[0].split("#", 1)[0] # Check before query/fragment
    
    if not original_url_had_scheme:
        # Only add if it doesn't look like an email address or something else with an @
        # This is a simple heuristic; proper validation is harder.
        # For now, assume if no :// it needs http.
        if "@" not in url.split("/")[0]: # Avoids turning "user@domain/path" into "http://user@domain/path" incorrectly
             url = "http://" + url

    parsed = urlparse(url)
    
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower()
    netloc = parsed.netloc.lower() # domain & port
    path = parsed.path
    query = parsed.query
    # fragment is explicitly removed by passing '' to urlunparse

    # Ensure scheme is http or https, default to http if it was something else weird
    # after our initial prepend. This handles if urlparse made it 'ftp' etc. from a bad prepend.
    # No, the goal is to normalize http/https, not change valid other schemes.
    # The initial problem was "HTTP://" not being lowercased. urlparse should handle this.
    # The prepending is mainly for "example.com" type inputs.

    # Remove default port
    if (scheme == "http" and netloc.endswith(":80")) or \
       (scheme == "https" and netloc.endswith(":443")):
        netloc = netloc.rsplit(":", 1)[0]
        
    # Path normalization for trailing slashes
    # "http://example.com/" -> path is "/" -> should become "" for urlunparse
    # "http://example.com/foo/" -> path is "/foo/" -> should become "/foo"
    # "http://example.com" -> path is "" -> stays ""
    # "http://example.com/foo" -> path is "/foo" -> stays "/foo"
    if path == "/":
        path = "" 
    elif path.endswith("/") and len(path) > 1: # len(path) > 1 ensures we don't make "" from "/" again
        path = path.rstrip("/")

    # Reconstruct, explicitly removing fragment by passing empty string
    normalized = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, path, '', query, ''))
        
    return normalized
```
This seems more robust for scheme handling and trailing slashes as per test cases.

Now for `extract_domain("ftp://another.example.org")` returning `None`:
The `extract_domain` function currently is:
```python
def extract_domain(url: str) -> str | None:
    try:
        normalized_url = url
        if not normalized_url.startswith(("http://", "https://")): # This is the issue for FTP
            normalized_url = "http://" + normalized_url 
            # This turns "ftp://another.example.org" into "http://ftp://another.example.org"
            # tldextract will then likely fail or give weird results.
            
        extracted = tldextract.extract(normalized_url)
        # ...
```
The problem is that it forces non-http/https URLs to start with `http://`, which mangles URLs like `ftp://...`. `tldextract` can handle various schemes if passed directly. We should only prepend `http://` if there's *no scheme at all*.

**Proposed change for `extract_domain`:**
```python
def extract_domain(url: str) -> str | None:
    try:
        # Check if a scheme is present. tldextract works better with schemes.
        parsed_check = urlparse(url.strip())
        url_to_extract = url.strip()

        if not parsed_check.scheme: # If no scheme like "example.com"
            url_to_extract = "http://" + url_to_extract
            
        extracted = tldextract.extract(url_to_extract)
        if extracted.registered_domain:
            return extracted.registered_domain
        return None
    except Exception:
        return None
```

I will now apply these changes to `normalize_url` and `extract_domain` in `crawler/crawler_module/utils.py`.

```python
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower()
    netloc = parsed.netloc.lower()
```

```python
    # Remove trailing slash unless it's the only thing in the path
    if normalized.endswith("/") and len(urlparse(normalized).path) > 1:
        normalized = normalized.rstrip("/")

    # we should respect the original scheme if one was truly there, or stick to http if not.
    # This logic is tricky. The goal is to normalize http/https and schemeless common inputs.
    if original_url_had_scheme:

        parsed_original_scheme = urlparse(url).scheme.lower()
        if parsed_original_scheme:

       (scheme == "https" and netloc.endswith(":443")):
        netloc = netloc.rsplit(":", 1)[0]
        
    # Path normalization for trailing slashes
    if path == "/":
        path = "" 
    elif path.endswith("/") and len(path) > 1:
        path = path.rstrip("/")

    # Reconstruct, explicitly removing fragment by passing empty string for fragment component

    return normalized

def extract_domain(url: str) -> str | None:
    """Extracts the registered domain from a URL."""
    try:
        url_to_extract = url.strip()
        parsed_check = urlparse(url_to_extract)

        if not parsed_check.scheme: # If no scheme like "example.com", prepend http for tldextract
            url_to_extract = "http://" + url_to_extract
            
        extracted = tldextract.extract(url_to_extract)
        if extracted.registered_domain:
            return extracted.registered_domain
        return None
    except Exception:
        # tldextract can sometimes fail on very malformed inputs
        return None

```

The `normalize_url` and `extract_domain` functions in `crawler/crawler_module/utils.py` have been updated.

The changes to `normalize_url` aim to:
- Correctly lowercase schemes and hostnames, even for URLs initially provided with uppercase schemes.
- Handle URLs without schemes by defaulting to `http`.
- Normalize trailing slashes such that `http://example.com/` becomes `http://example.com`, and `http://example.com/path/` becomes `http://example.com/path`.

The change to `extract_domain` ensures that `http://` is only prepended if the URL doesn't already have a scheme, which should allow `tldextract` to correctly process URLs like `ftp://another.example.org`.

These modifications should address the failing tests in `tests/test_utils.py`.

We have now addressed:
- The `NameError` for `AsyncMock` in `tests/test_politeness.py`.
- All identified `AssertionError`s in `tests/test_politeness.py` related to threaded DB calls by refactoring the tests to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`.
- The logic error in `PolitenessEnforcer._get_robots_for_domain` regarding HTTP 404 handling and HTTPS fallback.
- The `AssertionError`s in `tests/test_utils.py` related to `normalize_url` and `extract_domain`.

At this stage, it's highly recommended to run `pytest` again to see which failures, if any, persist. The majority of the initially reported errors should now be resolved.

Since I cannot run `pytest` myself, I'll stop here. Please run the tests, and we can address any remaining failures in the next step.

Looks great, now only 3 failures remain

**Cursor**

Okay, we're down to just 3 failures! This is great. Let's address them.

**Issue 1: Fixing robot rule string literals**

The failure `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success - AssertionError: assert True is False` is very likely due to the robot rule strings in the test file being "over-escaped" (e.g., `User-agent: *\\\\nDisallow: /onlyhttps` instead of `User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /onlyhttps`). If the parser receives a literal `\` followed by `n` instead of a newline, it won't interpret the `Disallow` directive correctly.

I'll correct these string literals in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` for the following tests and variables:
*   `test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success` (variable `new_robots_text`)
*   `test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success` (variable `robots_text`)
*   `test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success` (variable `robots_text_https`)

This involves changing `\\\\n` to `\\n` in the definition of these string variables.

```python
\
// ... existing code ...
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "staledb.com"
    stale_robots_text = "User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /old" # Ensure this is correct too if it was touched
    past_expiry = int(time.time()) - 1000
    new_robots_text = "User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /new" # Changed from \\\\n

    # ... rest of the test ...

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "newfetch.com"
    robots_text = "User-agent: *\\nAllow: /" # Changed from \\\\n

    # ... rest of the test ...

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "httpsfallback.com"
    robots_text_https = "User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /onlyhttps" # Changed from \\\\n

    # ... rest of the test ...
// ... existing code ...

```

It seems my instructions were a bit ambiguous, and the model changed `\n` to `\\n` in `stale_robots_text` as well, which is not what we wanted. We only wanted to correct the ones that were `\\n`. The initial `stale_robots_text = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /old"` was likely correct.

Let me try that edit again, more precisely. I will ensure only the `robots_text` and `robots_text_https` variables that were shown as `*\\n` (double backslash) get corrected to `*\n` (single backslash), and `new_robots_text` is also set to use a single backslash if it was also `*\\n`. The `stale_robots_text` should remain with a single backslash if that was its original correct state.

Looking back at the file content for `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` you provided, I see:
- `stale_robots_text = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /old"` (Line 142) - This is correct with a single `\n`.
- `new_robots_text = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /new"` (Line 144) - This is also correct with a single `\n`.
- `robots_text = "User-agent: *\\nAllow: /"` (Line 190) - This is where the `\\n` (escaped to `*\\n` in my previous reasoning) is. This should be `User-agent: *\nAllow: /`.
- `robots_text_https = "User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /onlyhttps"` (Line 228) - Similar here, should be `User-agent: *\nDisallow: /onlyhttps`.

The apply model's previous change actually made `stale_robots_text` and `new_robots_text` *incorrect* by changing `\n` to `\\n`.

I will make a more targeted change to fix `robots_text` (line 190) and `robots_text_https` (line 228) from `\\n` to `\n`, and revert the incorrect changes to `stale_robots_text` and `new_robots_text` if they were indeed changed to `\\n` by the last apply.

```python
// ... existing code ...
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_db_cache_stale_then_fetch_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "staledb.com"
    stale_robots_text = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /old"  # Should be single backslash
    past_expiry = int(time.time()) - 1000
    new_robots_text = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /new" # Should be single backslash
// ... existing code ...
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_no_cache_fetch_http_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "newfetch.com"
    robots_text = "User-agent: *\nAllow: /" # Changed from \\n to \n
// ... existing code ...
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "httpsfallback.com"
    robots_text_https = "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /onlyhttps" # Changed from \\n to \n
// ... existing code ...
```

Okay, the robot rule string literals should now be correct in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`. This should fix `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success - AssertionError: assert True is False`.

Now for the remaining two failures:
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch - assert False is True`
*   `FAILED tests/test_politeness.py::test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay - assert False is True`

Both of these are failing with `assert False is True`, meaning the `can_fetch_domain_now` method is returning `False` when the tests expect `True`.

Let's look at the `can_fetch_domain_now` method in `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`:
```python
    async def can_fetch_domain_now(self, domain: str) -> bool:
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        if not self.storage.conn: # <--- THIS IS THE PROBLEM
            logger.error("Cannot check fetch_domain_now, no DB connection.")
            return False # <--- RETURNS FALSE IF self.storage.conn is falsy

        last_fetch_time = 0
        try:
            def _db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded():
                # ... (connects to db_path, gets cursor, fetches time) ...
            # ...
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            logger.error(f"DB error checking can_fetch_domain_now for {domain}: {e}")
            return False 
            
        crawl_delay = await self.get_crawl_delay(domain)
        current_time = int(time.time())
        
        if current_time >= last_fetch_time + crawl_delay:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
The issue is the early `if not self.storage.conn:` check. In our test setup for `PolitenessEnforcer`, the `mock_storage_manager` has a `mock.conn` attribute, which is a `MagicMock`.
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_storage_manager(tmp_path: Path) -> MagicMock:
    mock = MagicMock(spec=StorageManager)
    mock.conn = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection) # <--- mock.conn is a MagicMock
    # ...
    return mock
```
A `MagicMock` object itself is truthy. However, the `PolitenessEnforcer`'s `storage` attribute is this `mock_storage_manager`. The code checks `self.storage.conn`. This `self.storage.conn` *is* the `MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)`, so it should be truthy.

The tests that are failing are:
1.  `test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch`
2.  `test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay`

These tests *do not* use the `patch('sqlite3.connect')` strategy that we applied to other tests. They still rely on mocking `politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor...`:
```python
# From test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch
mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = None
```
The method `can_fetch_domain_now` uses `_db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded` which *does* establish its own connection via `sqlite3.connect(db_path, ...)`.
The check `if not self.storage.conn:` is problematic because:
    a. It's somewhat irrelevant since the actual DB operation happens in a thread with its own connection.
    b. If `self.storage.conn` were ever `None` or a mock that evaluated to `False`, it would prematurely return `False`.

The `mock_storage_manager` fixture *does* set `mock.conn` to a `MagicMock`, which is truthy. So, `if not self.storage.conn:` should evaluate to `if not <MagicMock object>:`, which should be `False`, so it should *not* enter that block and return `False` prematurely.

This implies the reason for `assert False is True` (meaning `can_fetch_domain_now` returned `False`) must be one of the other `return False` paths:
- `except sqlite3.Error ... return False`
- The final `else: return False` if `current_time < last_fetch_time + crawl_delay`.

Let's re-examine `test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch`:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "newdomain.com"
    # This mock_cursor is for the main thread's StorageManager.conn, NOT the one used in the thread.
    mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
    mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = None # Simulate no record of last fetch

    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))

    assert await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain) is True # Fails: False is not True
    mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_once_with( # This assertion would also fail
        "SELECT last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,)
    )
```
The problem is clear now: these two tests (`test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch` and `test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay`) are still using the old mocking strategy for `mock_cursor`. The `fetchone.return_value` they set is never seen by `_db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded`.
When `_db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded` runs, its `cursor.fetchone()` will likely return `None` (if the in-memory sqlite DB is empty for that table/domain), causing `last_fetch_time` to remain `0`.

For `test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch`:
- `last_fetch_time` becomes `0`.
- `crawl_delay` is mocked to `MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS` (e.g., 70).
- `current_time >= 0 + 70` is `True`. So the method *should* return `True`.

The fact that it returns `False` suggests that either the `sqlite3.Error` exception path is taken, or the `if not self.storage.conn:` check *is* somehow failing.

Let's remove the `if not self.storage.conn:` check from `can_fetch_domain_now` as it's misleading and not robust given the threaded DB access. The threaded function handles its own connection. Also, let's remove a similar check from `record_domain_fetch_attempt`.

Then, we absolutely MUST refactor these two tests to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`.

**Step 1: Remove the `if not self.storage.conn:` checks.**

```python
    async def can_fetch_domain_now(self, domain: str) -> bool:
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        if not self.storage.conn: # <--- THIS IS THE PROBLEM
            logger.error("Cannot check fetch_domain_now, no DB connection.")
            return False # <--- RETURNS FALSE IF self.storage.conn is falsy

        last_fetch_time = 0
        try:
            def _db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded():
                # ... (connects to db_path, gets cursor, fetches time) ...
            # ...
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            logger.error(f"DB error checking can_fetch_domain_now for {domain}: {e}")
            return False 
            
        crawl_delay = await self.get_crawl_delay(domain)
        current_time = int(time.time())
        
        if current_time >= last_fetch_time + crawl_delay:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_storage_manager(tmp_path: Path) -> MagicMock:
    mock = MagicMock(spec=StorageManager)
    mock.conn = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection) # <--- mock.conn is a MagicMock
    # ...
    return mock
```

```python
# From test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch
mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = None
```

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "newdomain.com"
    # This mock_cursor is for the main thread's StorageManager.conn, NOT the one used in the thread.
    mock_cursor = politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor.return_value.__enter__.return_value
    mock_cursor.fetchone.return_value = None # Simulate no record of last fetch

    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))

    assert await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain) is True # Fails: False is not True
    mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_once_with( # This assertion would also fail
        "SELECT last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,)
    )
```

```python
// ... existing code ...
    async def can_fetch_domain_now(self, domain: str) -> bool:
        """Checks if the domain can be fetched based on last fetch time and crawl delay."""
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        # Removed: if not self.storage.conn:
        # logger.error("Cannot check fetch_domain_now, no DB connection.")
        # return False

        last_fetch_time = 0
// ... existing code ...
    async def record_domain_fetch_attempt(self, domain: str):
        """Records that we are about to fetch (or have fetched) from a domain."""
        db_path = self.storage.db_path
        # Removed: if not self.storage.conn:
        # logger.error("Cannot record domain fetch, no DB connection.")
        # return
        try:
// ... existing code ...
```

The redundant `if not self.storage.conn:` checks have been removed.

**Step 2: Refactor the two failing `can_fetch_domain_now` tests.**
I will now refactor `test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch` and `test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay` in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`.

```python
// ... existing code ...
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "newdomain.com"
    
    mock_db_cursor_instance = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_db_cursor_instance.fetchone.return_value = None # No record of last fetch in _db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded
    
    mock_db_conn_instance = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_db_conn_instance.cursor.return_value = mock_db_cursor_instance
    mock_db_conn_instance.__enter__.return_value = mock_db_conn_instance
    mock_db_conn_instance.__exit__.return_value = None

    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))

    with patch('sqlite3.connect', return_value=mock_db_conn_instance) as mock_sqlite_connect:
        can_fetch = await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain)

        mock_sqlite_connect.assert_called_once_with(politeness_enforcer.storage.db_path, timeout=10)
        mock_db_cursor_instance.execute.assert_called_once_with(
            "SELECT last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,)
        )
        mock_db_cursor_instance.fetchone.assert_called_once()

    assert can_fetch is True


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "readyagain.com"
    crawl_delay_val = 30.0
    last_fetch = int(time.time()) - int(crawl_delay_val) - 1 

    mock_db_cursor_instance = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_db_cursor_instance.fetchone.return_value = (last_fetch,) # Last fetch was just over delay ago
    
    mock_db_conn_instance = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_db_conn_instance.cursor.return_value = mock_db_cursor_instance
    mock_db_conn_instance.__enter__.return_value = mock_db_conn_instance
    mock_db_conn_instance.__exit__.return_value = None

    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=crawl_delay_val)

    with patch('sqlite3.connect', return_value=mock_db_conn_instance) as mock_sqlite_connect:
        can_fetch = await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain)
        
        mock_sqlite_connect.assert_called_once_with(politeness_enforcer.storage.db_path, timeout=10)
        mock_db_cursor_instance.execute.assert_called_once_with(
            "SELECT last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,)
        )
        mock_db_cursor_instance.fetchone.assert_called_once()

    assert can_fetch is True


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_insufficient_delay(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "notready.com"
// ... existing code ...
```

The tests `test_can_fetch_domain_now_no_previous_fetch` and `test_can_fetch_domain_now_after_sufficient_delay` have been refactored to use the `patch('sqlite3.connect')` approach. This ensures that their mocks for `fetchone().return_value` are correctly seen by the threaded database logic in `_db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded`.

With these changes, all 3 remaining test failures should now be addressed.
*   The string literal fix for `test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success`.
*   The removal of the misleading `if not self.storage.conn:` check and the correct mocking strategy for the two `test_can_fetch_domain_now_...` tests.

Hopefully, running `pytest` now will show all tests passing. I'll wait for you to confirm.

**User**

Before I run the tests, I notice you were having some issues with the tools and the auxiliary models that the environment provides you. Do you want to summarize some of those problems in a file META.MD?

---

**Cursor**

That's a thoughtful offer! Yes, I can certainly summarize some of the patterns and issues encountered during this debugging session, particularly regarding tool use and how the auxiliary models (like the one applying edits) interpret instructions. This could be useful for future reference.

Here's a plan for `META.MD`:

1.  **Tool Path Mismatches**: Note the instances where I initially used incorrect paths for tools like `read_file` (e.g., `tests/test_politeness.py` instead of `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`). This highlights the importance of precise path specification, especially in nested project structures.
2.  **Mocking Threaded Database Calls**: Detail the primary challenge we tackled: tests failing because they were mocking `MagicMock` instances on the main thread's objects, while the actual database calls were happening in separate threads (`asyncio.to_thread`) with their own `sqlite3.connect` instances. The solution was consistently using `patch('sqlite3.connect')`. This is a key learning for testing asynchronous code that delegates synchronous blocking I/O to threads.
3.  **Precision in `edit_file` Instructions**:
    *   Mention the instance where an `edit_file` instruction to change `\\n` to `\n` was slightly ambiguous and the apply model also changed existing correct `\n` to `\\n`. This underscores the need for very precise instructions and potentially using more context in the `code_edit` block to make the target clearer for the apply model, especially when dealing with character escapes.
    *   Reinforce the utility of the `// ... existing code ...` comment to minimize diffs while providing context.
4.  **Iterative Debugging for `AssertionError`s**: Briefly mention how `AssertionError` messages (e.g., `assert X == Y`) were used to deduce logical errors in the source code (like the `robots.txt` HTTP 404 then HTTPS fallback logic) or in test mock setups.

I will now create `crawler/META.MD` with these points.

# Meta-Observations from Debugging Session

This document summarizes some key observations and challenges encountered during the recent debugging session for the web crawler project, primarily focusing on tool interactions and common pitfalls in testing asynchronous, threaded code.

## 1. Tool Path Precision

*   **Issue**: Several initial tool calls (e.g., `read_file`) failed due to incorrect file paths. For instance, specifying `tests/test_politeness.py` instead of the correct `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`.
*   **Observation**: Workspace-relative paths need to be exact, especially when dealing with source code organized into subdirectories (like `crawler_module/` and `tests/` within the main `crawler/` project folder). Careful attention to the full relative path from the workspace root is crucial.

## 2. Mocking Database Calls in Threads

*   **Issue**: A significant number of test failures in `tests/test_politeness.py` (e.g., `AssertionError: assert 0 > 0` or `assert 0 == 2` for call counts, `assert True is False` when expecting DB-driven results) stemmed from an incorrect mocking strategy. Tests were initially attempting to mock cursor objects derived from a `StorageManager` instance's connection attribute (`politeness_enforcer.storage.conn.cursor`).
*   **Root Cause**: The methods under test (like `_get_robots_for_domain`, `is_url_allowed`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, `record_domain_fetch_attempt` in `PolitenessEnforcer`) used `asyncio.to_thread` to run their synchronous SQLite database operations. These threaded functions established *new* `sqlite3.connect()` instances, bypassing the mocks set up on the main thread's `StorageManager`'s connection.
*   **Solution**: The consistent and correct approach was to use `unittest.mock.patch('sqlite3.connect')`. This allowed tests to provide a mock connection object (and subsequently a mock cursor) that would be used by the code running within the separate thread. Assertions could then be correctly made against this thread-specific mock cursor and connection.
*   **Key Takeaway**: When testing functions that delegate blocking I/O to threads, mocks must target the point where the resource (like a DB connection) is acquired *within that thread's context*.

## 3. Precision in `edit_file` Tool Instructions

*   **Issue**: When attempting to correct escaped newline characters in string literals (from `\\\\n` to `\\n`) using `edit_file`, an initial, slightly less precise instruction led to the "apply model" also incorrectly changing valid `\\n` sequences to `\\\\n` in adjacent, correctly formatted strings.
*   **Observation**: The `edit_file` tool, while powerful, relies on an auxiliary model to apply the changes. Instructions should be as unambiguous as possible.
    *   **Specificity**: Clearly identify the exact lines or variable names if the change is targeted.
    *   **Context**: Providing slightly more surrounding context (even if unchanged and marked with `// ... existing code ...`) can help the apply model pinpoint the exact location, especially for subtle changes like character escapes.
    *   **Iterative Refinement**: If an edit isn't applied as expected, re-evaluating the `code_edit` block and `instructions` for clarity is necessary. The `reapply` tool can be useful, but first ensuring the instruction itself is optimal is key.

## 4. Iterative Debugging Process

*   **Observation**: The process involved:
    1.  Identifying a failing test from the `pytest` summary.
    2.  Examining the specific `AssertionError` or `NameError`.
    3.  Reading the relevant test code and source code (using `read_file`).
    4.  Forming a hypothesis for the failure (e.g., incorrect mock, logic error in source).
    5.  Applying a fix using `edit_file`.
    6.  (Implicitly) Re-running tests to confirm fixes and identify next failures.
*   **Note**: This iterative loop is standard in debugging, and the tools facilitated focused investigation of specific code sections based on test outputs.

These meta-observations can help in streamlining future development and debugging interactions within this environment.

I've created the `crawler/META.MD` file with the summary of observations from our debugging session.

You can now proceed to run the tests. I'm hopeful that all the failures we've addressed will be resolved! Let me know how it goes.

**User**

It works! Nice job. Do you want to summarize the work and append to CHAT.md?

**Cursor**

That's fantastic news! I'm glad we could get all the tests passing.

Yes, I can definitely summarize the work from this session and append it to `crawler/CHAT.MD`.
I'll focus on the key fixes we implemented:

1.  Resolving `NameError` for `AsyncMock` by adding the import in `tests/test_politeness.py`.
2.  Correcting the primary issue in `tests/test_politeness.py` where numerous tests failed due to improper mocking of database operations occurring in separate threads. This involved refactoring affected tests to use `patch('sqlite3.connect')`.
3.  Fixing the logic in `PolitenessEnforcer._get_robots_for_domain` to correctly handle HTTP 404 responses and ensure an HTTPS fallback attempt.
4.  Addressing string literal escaping for robot rules in `tests/test_politeness.py`.
5.  Removing potentially problematic early-exit conditions (`if not self.storage.conn:`) in `PolitenessEnforcer` methods.
6.  Refining `normalize_url` and `extract_domain` in `crawler_module/utils.py` to correctly handle trailing slashes, scheme casing, and non-HTTP URLs, resolving failures in `tests/test_utils.py`.

I'll first read the current `crawler/CHAT.MD` to find the best place to add this summary, likely updating or adding to Section 5, which previously listed the known test failures.

Okay, I've read `crawler/CHAT.MD`. Section 5, "Current Known Test Failures & Debugging Notes (as of last update)," is the perfect place to update. I'll replace the content of that section with a summary of the fixes we just implemented and note that all tests are now passing.

```markdown
// ... existing code ...
This iterative process of planning, implementing features module by module, writing tests, and debugging issues (especially around asynchronous operations and database threading) has brought the project to a runnable state, ready for further testing and refinement.

## 5. Test Suite Refinement and Bug Resolution (Session Post-Summary)

Following the previous summary, a dedicated debugging session was undertaken to address the listed test failures. All previously reported test failures have now been resolved. Key fixes included:

*   **`tests/test_politeness.py` - `NameError` Resolution**:
    *   Added the missing `from unittest.mock import AsyncMock` import to resolve `NameError: name 'AsyncMock' is not defined` in multiple tests.

*   **`tests/test_politeness.py` - `AssertionError` Fixes (Threaded DB Mocking)**:
    *   The primary cause for many `AssertionError`s (e.g., `assert 0 > 0`, `assert 0 == 2`, `assert True is False`) in tests for `_get_robots_for_domain`, `is_url_allowed`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, and `record_domain_fetch_attempt` was identified as incorrect mocking of database operations that occur in separate threads via `asyncio.to_thread`.
    *   Affected tests were refactored to correctly use `unittest.mock.patch('sqlite3.connect')`. This ensures that a mock connection and cursor are injected into the context of the threaded database function, allowing test assertions to accurately verify database interactions (e.g., `fetchone()` return values, `execute()` call counts and parameters, `commit()` calls).

*   **`crawler_module/politeness.py` - Logic and String Literal Fixes**:
    *   Corrected the logic in `_get_robots_for_domain` to ensure that an HTTPS fallback fetch for `robots.txt` is attempted if the initial HTTP attempt results in a 404 error (or any other non-200 status). This fixed `test_get_robots_http_404_https_404` which was failing due to an incorrect fetcher call count.
    *   Ensured that robot rule string literals (e.g., `robots_text`, `robots_text_https`) in `tests/test_politeness.py` used correct newline characters (`\n`) instead of potentially over-escaped versions (`\\n`), which could affect parser behavior and lead to assertion failures like in `test_get_robots_http_fail_then_https_success`.
    *   Removed potentially misleading `if not self.storage.conn:` checks from `can_fetch_domain_now` and `record_domain_fetch_attempt` as the threaded helper functions within them establish their own database connections.

*   **`crawler_module/utils.py` - Normalization and Extraction Fixes**:
    *   Refined the `normalize_url` function to correctly handle scheme lowercasing (e.g., `HTTP://` to `http://`), defaulting of schemeless URLs, and removal of trailing slashes (e.g., `http://example.com/` to `http://example.com`) to match test expectations.
    *   Updated the `extract_domain` function to only prepend `http://` if no scheme is already present. This allows `tldextract` to correctly process URLs with non-HTTP schemes (e.g., `ftp://`) instead of mangling them.
    *   These changes resolved the `AssertionError` failures previously noted in `tests/test_utils.py`.

With these changes, all unit tests are currently passing, indicating a more stable and correctly functioning set of core modules for the crawler.

```

Excellent. The `crawler/CHAT.MD` file has been updated with a new Section 5 detailing the fixes from this session and confirming that all tests are now passing.

It was a productive session! We systematically addressed each test failure, identified root causes (often related to the nuances of mocking threaded code), and applied targeted fixes to both the test suite and the underlying crawler logic. The `META.MD` file should also serve as a good reminder of some of the patterns we observed.

Is there anything else I can help you with on this project today?
