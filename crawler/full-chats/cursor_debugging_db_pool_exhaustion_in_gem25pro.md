# Debugging DB pool exhaustion in web crawler

Yesterday we implemented DB pooling and fixed a bunch of tests to help scale the web crawler. This allowed the crawler to scale to 500 workers (I haven't tried more). I ran this job overnight:
```
python main.py --seed-file top-1M-domains.txt --email example@gmail.com --max-workers 500 --seeded-urls-only 2>&1 | tee -a test-2025-05-30.log
```

In the morning I found that the crawler had successfully finished loading robots for all 1M seed domains, but immediately on starting the main loop all the workers ran into errors about the DB pool being exhausted. The logs look like so (log file is super big, don't try reading the whole thing):
```

grepping the logs for "Processing URL ID" which would indicate at least 1 worker successfully pulled a URL from the frontier shows 0 results. So looks like all the workers fail to pull URLs. I think the problem is that in `frontier.get_next_url()` each worker tries to start 2 new connections, but the pool size is the same as the number of workers, does that sound right to you?

You can read the docs in PLAN.MD or our past chats in full-chats for more info

You're right to suspect `frontier.get_next_url()` in conjunction with the database connection pool. Your observation that each worker might be effectively trying to use more than one connection from the pool simultaneously, even if indirectly, is key here.

Here's a breakdown of why this is likely happening:

1.  **`frontier.get_next_url()` Acquires a Connection:**
    Each worker calls `await self.frontier.get_next_url()`. The first thing `get_next_url()` does is:
    ```python
    conn_from_pool = self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()
    ```
    This successfully (initially) gets one connection from the pool for each worker. If `max_workers` is 500 and `pool_size` is 500, this step would consume all available connections in the pool.

2.  **Politeness Checks Also Need Connections:**
    Inside the loop within `get_next_url()`, there are calls to politeness methods:
    ```python
    if not await self.politeness.is_url_allowed(url):
        # ...
    if await self.politeness.can_fetch_domain_now(domain):
        # ...
    ```
    The log message `WARNING - crawler_module.politeness [15784] - Pool error checking manual exclusion for 777aziino.com: No connection available from pool for crawler_data/crawler_state.db within timeout.` strongly indicates that these politeness methods (or methods they call internally, like the one for checking manual exclusion) also need to access the database and therefore attempt to acquire *another* connection from the pool.

3.  **Pool Exhaustion:**
    So, a single worker executing `get_next_url()`:
    *   Holds one connection (`conn_from_pool`).
    *   Then, when it `await`s a politeness check (e.g., `self.politeness.is_url_allowed(url)`), that politeness method tries to get *another* connection from the pool.
    *   Since all 500 initial connections are already held by the 500 workers (one each for their `conn_from_pool`), there are no connections left for the politeness checks. This leads to the "pool exhausted" errors.

Effectively, each worker attempts to use *at least two* connections concurrently during the `get_next_url()` phase: one for the main frontier database operations and another for the politeness database operations. With a pool size equal to `max_workers`, this will immediately lead to contention and exhaustion.

To confirm the behavior of the politeness module, I'll search the codebase for how it uses database connections.


```python
    conn_from_pool = self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()
```

```python
    if not await self.politeness.is_url_allowed(url):
        # ...
    if await self.politeness.can_fetch_domain_now(domain):
        # ...
```

The search results confirm our suspicion. The `PolitenessEnforcer` class, specifically in methods like `is_url_allowed`, `_get_robots_for_domain`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, and `record_domain_fetch_attempt`, frequently calls `self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()` to acquire database connections for its operations.

Therefore, the sequence in `frontier.py`'s `get_next_url` method:

1.  `conn_from_pool = self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()` (Worker gets 1st connection)
2.  `await self.politeness.is_url_allowed(url)` (Politeness tries to get 2nd connection)

...will lead to pool exhaustion when many workers (e.g., 500) attempt this concurrently with a pool size of 500.

**The core issue is that a single logical operation within a worker (`get_next_url`) is trying to acquire multiple connections from the pool sequentially without releasing the first one, while other workers are doing the same.**

There are a few ways to address this:

1.  **Increase Pool Size:** A simple, but potentially resource-intensive fix, would be to increase the DB pool size to, say, `max_workers * 2` or `max_workers * 3`. This might alleviate the immediate problem but doesn't address the underlying pattern of holding a connection while waiting for another task that also needs a connection. It could also lead to a very high number of open database connections.

2.  **Pass Connections Through:** The `FrontierManager`'s `get_next_url` method already has `conn_from_pool`. This connection could be passed down to the politeness methods that need it. This would mean that `is_url_allowed`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, etc., would need to be refactored to accept an optional `sqlite3.Connection` argument. If a connection is provided, they use it; otherwise, they get one from the pool. This is a more precise solution.

3.  **Restructure `get_next_url`:** Ensure that database-dependent politeness checks are done *before* or *after* the main database transaction in `get_next_url`, or that the connection is released and reacquired if the politeness checks are truly independent and might take time. This seems more complex than option 2.

Option 2 (passing the existing connection) is generally the cleanest way to handle this, as it makes the connection management more explicit and avoids increasing the pool size unnecessarily.

Would you like me to proceed with refactoring the `PolitenessEnforcer` and `FrontierManager` to implement this connection passing strategy?Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Yes, please refactor the code to pass the existing connection from `get_next_url` to the politeness methods.

It sounds like we need to:
1. Modify `PolitenessEnforcer` methods (`is_url_allowed`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, and their helper methods like `_get_robots_for_domain`, `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync_threaded_pooled`, `_db_get_last_fetch_sync_threaded_pooled`, `_db_record_fetch_sync_threaded_pooled`) to accept an optional `sqlite3.Connection` argument.
    * If a connection is provided, they use it.
    * If no connection is provided (e.g., when called from other parts of the code), they get a new one from the pool as they do now.
2. Update `FrontierManager.get_next_url` to pass its `conn_from_pool` to the relevant `PolitenessEnforcer` calls.
3. We should also check `PolitenessEnforcer.record_domain_fetch_attempt` as it's called within `get_next_url` as well and likely needs the same treatment.

This seems like the most surgical approach. Let's do it.

ok i've given you the tools, please make the changes

Okay, I understand the plan. We'll refactor `PolitenessEnforcer` methods to accept an optional `sqlite3.Connection` argument. If a connection is provided, the methods will use it directly; otherwise, they'll fetch one from the pool. This connection will then be passed down to the synchronous helper functions, which will also be modified to use the provided connection if available, or manage their own pool connection otherwise.

I'll start by applying these changes to `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py`.

```

The changes to `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py` seem to have been applied successfully. I've refactored the main public methods (`is_url_allowed`, `can_fetch_domain_now`, `get_crawl_delay`, `record_domain_fetch_attempt`, and `_get_robots_for_domain`) to accept an optional `conn_in: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = None` argument.

I've also created new internal synchronous helper methods (e.g., `_db_get_cached_robots_sync`, `_db_update_robots_cache_sync`, `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync`, `_db_get_last_fetch_sync`, `_db_record_fetch_sync`) that now take `conn_in` as a parameter. These helpers manage the connection: if `conn_in` is provided, they use it; otherwise, they acquire a new one from the pool and ensure it's returned. The `asyncio.to_thread` calls in the async public methods now pass `conn_in` to these new sync helpers.

The `_load_manual_exclusions` method was also updated similarly, although it's called during initialization, so it will typically manage its own connection unless one is explicitly passed (which is not the current usage).

Next, I'll modify `crawler/crawler_module/frontier.py` to pass the `conn_from_pool` to the `PolitenessEnforcer` methods within `get_next_url`.

```python
// ... existing code ...
            for url_id, url, domain in candidates:
                # Politeness check is async, happens outside the threaded DB operation
                # Pass the existing connection to politeness methods
                if not await self.politeness.is_url_allowed(url, conn_from_pool):
                    logger.debug(f"URL {url} disallowed by politeness rules. Removing from frontier (pool).")
                    
                    def _delete_disallowed_url_sync_threaded_pooled(conn: sqlite3.Connection):
// ... existing code ...
                    self.seen_urls.add(url) 
                    continue 

                if await self.politeness.can_fetch_domain_now(domain, conn_from_pool):
                    await self.politeness.record_domain_fetch_attempt(domain, conn_from_pool) # Async, non-DB
                    
                    def _delete_selected_url_sync_threaded_pooled(conn: sqlite3.Connection):
// ... existing code ...

```

The changes in `crawler/crawler_module/frontier.py` have been applied. The `conn_from_pool` variable is now passed to `self.politeness.is_url_allowed()`, `self.politeness.can_fetch_domain_now()`, and `self.politeness.record_domain_fetch_attempt()` within the `get_next_url()` method.

This should resolve the connection pool exhaustion issue by ensuring that these deeply nested calls reuse the existing database connection obtained by `get_next_url()` instead of trying to acquire new ones from an already depleted pool.

Do you want to review these changes, or shall I look for anything else?

cool, now we have to fix some test failures


---

**Cursor**

Okay, it looks like the refactoring of connection handling in `PolitenessEnforcer` has affected how those methods interact with mocks in your tests. The "expected call not found" errors usually point to a mismatch between how a mocked method is expected to be called and how it's actually called (or not called at all).

I'll need to examine `tests/test_politeness.py` to see how the mocks are configured for `test_is_url_allowed_by_robots`, `test_is_url_allowed_robots_fetch_fails_defaults_to_allow`, and `test_can_fetch_domain_now_insufficient_delay`.

I'll be looking for:
1.  How `db_pool.get_connection` is mocked and whether it's expected to be called.
2.  How methods like `_get_robots_for_domain`, `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync`, `_db_get_last_fetch_sync` are mocked (if at all) and if their new `conn_in` parameter is accounted for.
3.  If `asyncio.to_thread` is being asserted, whether the arguments passed to the threaded function (now including `conn_in=None` by default if not passed) are correct.

Let's get the content of the test file.

Ah, it seems I made a mistake with the file path. The correct path is likely `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`. I'll try reading it again.

My apologies, the line numbers must be 1-indexed. Let me correct that.

Okay, I have the content of `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py`.

The key change we made was adding `conn_in: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = None` to several `PolitenessEnforcer` methods, including the internal `_get_robots_for_domain`. When `is_url_allowed` or `can_fetch_domain_now` call `_get_robots_for_domain`, they now pass their own `conn_in` argument.

Many tests directly mock `_get_robots_for_domain` on the `politeness_enforcer` instance (e.g., `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(...)`). These mocks need to be updated to expect the `conn_in` argument.

Let's look at the failing tests:

1.  **`test_is_url_allowed_by_robots` (Lines 392-430)**
    *   It mocks `politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection` for the manual exclusion check. This part should still work as `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` will call it if `conn_in` is `None`.
    *   It then mocks `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(return_value=rerp_instance)`.
    *   The assertion `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain)` is failing because the actual call is now `_get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in=mock_conn_manual_exclusion)`.

2.  **`test_is_url_allowed_robots_fetch_fails_defaults_to_allow` (Lines 444-462)**
    *   Similar to the above, it mocks `storage.db_pool.get_connection` for manual exclusion and then mocks `_get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(return_value=None)`.
    *   The assertion `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain)` will fail for the same reason: `conn_in` is now passed.

3.  **`test_can_fetch_domain_now_insufficient_delay` (Lines 556-574)**
    *   This test mocks `_db_get_last_fetch_sync` (via `asyncio.to_thread`) and `get_crawl_delay`.
    *   `get_crawl_delay` internally calls `_get_robots_for_domain`. The mock for `get_crawl_delay` is `politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))`.
    *   The actual call to `get_crawl_delay` inside `can_fetch_domain_now` is now `await self.get_crawl_delay(domain, conn_in)`.
    *   So, the mock `politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain)` will fail because it's called with `(domain, conn_in_value)`.

**General Solution for these tests:**

The `AsyncMock`s for `_get_robots_for_domain` and `get_crawl_delay` need to be updated to expect the `conn_in` argument. Since the exact connection object passed might be tricky to assert directly if it's a mock itself, we can use `unittest.mock.ANY` for the `conn_in` parameter if we don't care about its specific value in the test, or ensure the mock is set up to expect the specific mock connection.

Let's start by fixing `test_is_url_allowed_by_robots`. I will update the assertion for `_get_robots_for_domain` to expect the `conn_in` argument.

```python
// ... existing code ...
    # --- Test Allowed URL ---
    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(allowed_url) is True
    # Verify _get_robots_for_domain was called, as it wasn't manually excluded.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)

    # --- Reset for next test case ---
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.reset_mock()
// ... existing code ...
    # --- Test Disallowed URL ---
    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(disallowed_url) is False
    # Verify _get_robots_for_domain was called again.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)

    # Check that the db_pool's get_connection was called for each is_url_allowed call (for manual exclusion)
// ... existing code ...
```

The change for `test_is_url_allowed_by_robots` looks correct. The linter errors are pre-existing and related to the project structure/stubs, not the change I just made, so I'll ignore them for now.

Next, I'll apply a similar fix to `test_is_url_allowed_robots_fetch_fails_defaults_to_allow`.

```python
// ... existing code ...
    politeness_enforcer.robots_parsers.pop(domain, None)
    
    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(url) is True 
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.assert_called_once() # For manual exclusion
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)

# --- Tests for get_crawl_delay (async) ---
@pytest.mark.asyncio
// ... existing code ...
```

That change is also applied correctly.

Now for `test_can_fetch_domain_now_insufficient_delay`. This one is slightly different because `get_crawl_delay` is called, which *internally* calls `_get_robots_for_domain`. The mock is on `get_crawl_delay` itself.

In `can_fetch_domain_now`:
```python
# Use passed-in connection for this synchronous DB operation executed in a thread
row = await asyncio.to_thread(self._db_get_last_fetch_sync, domain, conn_in)
# ...
# Pass the connection to get_crawl_delay (which passes to _get_robots_for_domain)
crawl_delay = await self.get_crawl_delay(domain, conn_in)
```
The test currently has:
```python
    # ...
    # Mock get_crawl_delay
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))
    # ...
    assert await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain) is False
    # ...
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain)
```
The assertion `politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain)` needs to be updated to `politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_db_conn)`.

The `mock_db_conn` in this test is set up for the `_db_get_last_fetch_sync` part:
```python
    mock_db_cursor = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_db_cursor.fetchone.return_value = (last_fetch_timestamp,) 
    mock_db_conn = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_db_conn.cursor.return_value = mock_db_cursor
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value = mock_db_conn
```
This same `mock_db_conn` will be passed as `conn_in` to `get_crawl_delay` because `can_fetch_domain_now` uses its own `conn_in` (which would be this `mock_db_conn` in the test's scenario since the test sets up `get_connection` to return it).

```python
# Use passed-in connection for this synchronous DB operation executed in a thread
row = await asyncio.to_thread(self._db_get_last_fetch_sync, domain, conn_in)
# ...
# Pass the connection to get_crawl_delay (which passes to _get_robots_for_domain)
crawl_delay = await self.get_crawl_delay(domain, conn_in)
```

```python
    # ...
    # Mock get_crawl_delay
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))
    # ...
    assert await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain) is False
    # ...
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain)
```

```python
    mock_db_cursor = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_db_cursor.fetchone.return_value = (last_fetch_timestamp,) 
    mock_db_conn = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_db_conn.cursor.return_value = mock_db_cursor
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value = mock_db_conn
```

```python
// ... existing code ...
    mock_db_conn.cursor.return_value = mock_db_cursor
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value = mock_db_conn

    # Mock get_crawl_delay
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay = AsyncMock(return_value=float(MIN_CRAWL_DELAY_SECONDS))

    assert await politeness_enforcer.can_fetch_domain_now(domain) is False

    # Check that _db_get_last_fetch_sync was called via asyncio.to_thread
    # This requires a bit more intricate checking if we want to assert to_thread directly.
    # For now, checking the DB connection and cursor mocks is a good proxy.
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.assert_called_once()
    mock_db_conn.cursor.assert_called_once()
    mock_db_cursor.execute.assert_called_once_with(
        "SELECT last_scheduled_fetch_timestamp FROM domain_metadata WHERE domain = ?", (domain,)
    )
    # And assert that get_crawl_delay was called with the domain and the connection
    politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_db_conn)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_can_fetch_domain_now_db_error(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
// ... existing code ...
```

The edits for all three failing tests in `crawler/tests/test_politeness.py` are now complete. I've updated the mock assertions to account for the new `conn_in` parameter being passed to the mocked methods (`_get_robots_for_domain` and `get_crawl_delay`).

The core idea was to ensure that when a method is mocked (e.g., `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(...)`), the subsequent `assert_called_once_with(...)` includes the `conn_in` argument with the expected connection object (which is often another mock, like `mock_conn_manual_exclusion` or `mock_db_conn` from the test setup).

With these changes, the tests should now correctly reflect the updated method signatures and pass.

Would you like me to run the tests or is there anything else you'd like to address?

hm, still failing, looks like this is the failing assertion:
```
        # --- Test Allowed URL ---

```

**Cursor**

You're right, the tests are still failing with the same "expected call not found" error, specifically for `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)`.

This is puzzling because we updated the assertion to include `mock_conn_manual_exclusion`.

Let's re-examine the setup for `test_is_url_allowed_by_robots`:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_is_url_allowed_by_robots(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "robotsallowed.com"
    allowed_url = f"http://{domain}/allowed"
    # ...

    # 1. Mock for the manual exclusion DB check.
    mock_cursor_manual_exclusion = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_cursor_manual_exclusion.fetchone.return_value = (0,) # Simulate domain is NOT manually excluded
    
    mock_conn_manual_exclusion = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_conn_manual_exclusion.cursor.return_value = mock_cursor_manual_exclusion
    
    # Configure the pool to return this connection for the manual exclusion check.
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value = mock_conn_manual_exclusion

    # 2. Mock _get_robots_for_domain to return a pre-configured RERP instance.
    rerp_instance = RobotExclusionRulesParser()
    rerp_instance.parse(robots_text)
    
    # Patch the _get_robots_for_domain method on the instance.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(return_value=rerp_instance) # THIS IS THE KEY

    # --- Test Allowed URL ---
    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(allowed_url) is True
    # Verify _get_robots_for_domain was called, as it wasn't manually excluded.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)
```

The issue is how `_get_robots_for_domain` is mocked.
When we do `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(return_value=rerp_instance)`, the `AsyncMock` we assign *replaces* the actual `_get_robots_for_domain` method. The new `conn_in` parameter we added to the original `_get_robots_for_domain` signature isn't inherently part of this standalone `AsyncMock`'s signature unless we explicitly define it or let it accept `*args, **kwargs`.

The `is_url_allowed` method calls it like this:
`rerp = await self._get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in)`

The `AsyncMock` assigned to `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain` is being called with two arguments (`domain` and `conn_in`), but the `assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)` is checking against this *mock object*.

The most straightforward fix is to make the `AsyncMock` expect to be called with two arguments when we set it up, or to use `unittest.mock.ANY` if we don't need to assert the specific connection instance passed to the *mocked* `_get_robots_for_domain`.

However, the connection object (`mock_conn_manual_exclusion`) *is* important here because `is_url_allowed` is supposed to pass the connection it used for the manual exclusion check down to `_get_robots_for_domain`.

Let's adjust the test to correctly assert the call on the `AsyncMock`. The current assertion `assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)` *should* be correct if the `AsyncMock` correctly receives these arguments.

The problem might be subtle:
When `is_url_allowed` calls `await self._get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in)`, the `conn_in` it passes is the one it obtained for the `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` call.
In the test, `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` is called via `asyncio.to_thread`.
The `conn_in` argument to `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` would be `None` initially within `is_url_allowed` because `is_url_allowed` itself is called without a `conn_in` in this test:
`await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(allowed_url)` (no second argument).

So, inside `is_url_allowed(url, conn_in=None)`:
1.  `conn_for_manual_exclusion_check` is obtained by `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` (which gets it from the pool, mocked to be `mock_conn_manual_exclusion`).
2.  Then `_get_robots_for_domain` is called as `await self._get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in=None)` because the `conn_in` of `is_url_allowed` itself is `None`.

This is the error! The `_get_robots_for_domain` method *should* be called with the connection used for the manual exclusion, but it's being called with the `conn_in` of its parent `is_url_allowed`, which is `None` in this test's invocation.

The `is_url_allowed` method needs to pass the connection it *established or received* for the manual exclusion check to `_get_robots_for_domain`.

Let's look at `politeness.py` for `is_url_allowed`:
```python
# crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py
# ...
async def is_url_allowed(self, url: str, conn_in: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = None) -> bool:
    # ...
    try:
        # row = await asyncio.to_thread(self._db_check_manual_exclusion_sync, domain, conn_in) <--- conn_in is used here
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Error checking manual exclusion for {domain}: {e}")

    # Pass the connection to _get_robots_for_domain
    rerp = await self._get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in) # <--- conn_in is used AGAIN.
    # ...
```
The issue is that `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` *internally* manages getting a connection from the pool if `conn_in` is `None`. This internally obtained connection is *not* what's then passed to `_get_robots_for_domain`. `is_url_allowed` simply passes its *own* `conn_in` argument to both.

If `is_url_allowed` is called with `conn_in=None` (as in the test), then:
1. `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync(domain, conn_in=None)` is called. This sync function then gets `mock_conn_manual_exclusion` from the pool and returns it.
2. `_get_robots_for_domain(domain, conn_in=None)` is called. This is where the assertion fails because it expects `mock_conn_manual_exclusion`.

The `is_url_allowed` method needs to capture the connection used by `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` if it had to create one, and pass *that specific connection* to `_get_robots_for_domain`.

This is more complex than just a test fix. The logic in `is_url_allowed` needs a slight adjustment.

The refactoring of the synchronous DB helper methods was designed so they *can* use an external connection but will manage their own if one isn't provided. However, the async public methods that call these helpers need to be smart about it.

If an async method like `is_url_allowed` is meant to use a *single* connection for a sequence of operations, it should:
1.  Obtain a connection (either from its `conn_in` or from the pool if `conn_in` is `None`).
2.  Pass this *same* connection to all subsequent helper calls (`_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync`, `_get_robots_for_domain`).
3.  If it obtained the connection from the pool (because its `conn_in` was `None`), it should be responsible for returning it.

Let's refine `is_url_allowed` in `politeness.py`.

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_is_url_allowed_by_robots(politeness_enforcer: PolitenessEnforcer, dummy_config: CrawlerConfig):
    domain = "robotsallowed.com"
    allowed_url = f"http://{domain}/allowed"
    # ...

    # 1. Mock for the manual exclusion DB check.
    mock_cursor_manual_exclusion = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Cursor)
    mock_cursor_manual_exclusion.fetchone.return_value = (0,) # Simulate domain is NOT manually excluded
    
    mock_conn_manual_exclusion = MagicMock(spec=sqlite3.Connection)
    mock_conn_manual_exclusion.cursor.return_value = mock_cursor_manual_exclusion
    
    # Configure the pool to return this connection for the manual exclusion check.
    politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value = mock_conn_manual_exclusion

    # 2. Mock _get_robots_for_domain to return a pre-configured RERP instance.
    rerp_instance = RobotExclusionRulesParser()
    rerp_instance.parse(robots_text)
    
    # Patch the _get_robots_for_domain method on the instance.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain = AsyncMock(return_value=rerp_instance) # THIS IS THE KEY

    # --- Test Allowed URL ---
    assert await politeness_enforcer.is_url_allowed(allowed_url) is True
    # Verify _get_robots_for_domain was called, as it wasn't manually excluded.
    politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)
```

```python

            return True

        conn_managed_internally = False
        active_conn: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = conn_in

        if active_conn is None:
            try:
                active_conn = self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()
                conn_managed_internally = True

            if not manual_exclusion_check_passed:

            rerp = await self._get_robots_for_domain(domain, active_conn)

                is_allowed_by_robots = rerp.is_allowed(self.config.user_agent, url)
                if not is_allowed_by_robots:

                return is_allowed_by_robots
            
            logger.warning(f"No robots.txt parser available for {domain} after checks. Allowing URL: {url}")
            return True # Default to allow if RERP is None

        finally:
            if conn_managed_internally and active_conn:
                self.storage.db_pool.return_connection(active_conn)
// ... existing code ...

```

The refactoring of `is_url_allowed` is complete. Now, if `conn_in` is `None`, `is_url_allowed` will get a connection from the pool, use this `active_conn` for both `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` and `_get_robots_for_domain`, and then ensure it's returned to the pool in a `finally` block. If `conn_in` is provided, it will use that connection for both calls and will not manage (get/return) it.

This change in `is_url_allowed` means that in `test_is_url_allowed_by_robots` (and `test_is_url_allowed_robots_fetch_fails_defaults_to_allow`), when `is_url_allowed` is called:
1. `is_url_allowed`'s `conn_in` will be `None`.
2. It will attempt to get `active_conn` from `self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()`.
3. In the test, `politeness_enforcer.storage.db_pool.get_connection.return_value` is set to `mock_conn_manual_exclusion`. So, `active_conn` becomes `mock_conn_manual_exclusion`.
4. This `mock_conn_manual_exclusion` will be passed to `_db_check_manual_exclusion_sync` and then to `_get_robots_for_domain`.

Therefore, the assertion `politeness_enforcer._get_robots_for_domain.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_conn_manual_exclusion)` should now pass because `_get_robots_for_domain` (which is the `AsyncMock` in the test) will indeed be called with `mock_conn_manual_exclusion` as its second argument.

The same logic applies to `test_is_url_allowed_robots_fetch_fails_defaults_to_allow`.

Now let's adjust `can_fetch_domain_now` in a similar way. It also makes two calls that potentially need a shared connection: `_db_get_last_fetch_sync` and `get_crawl_delay` (which in turn calls `_get_robots_for_domain`).

```python
// ... existing code ...
    async def can_fetch_domain_now(self, domain: str, conn_in: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = None) -> bool:
        """Checks if the domain can be fetched. Uses provided conn for DB ops."""
        last_fetch_time = 0
        
        conn_managed_internally = False
        active_conn: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = conn_in

        if active_conn is None:
            try:
                active_conn = self.storage.db_pool.get_connection()
                conn_managed_internally = True
            except Exception as e: # Catch pool errors specifically
                logger.error(f"Failed to get DB connection for can_fetch_domain_now ({domain}): {e}")
                return False # If DB is unavailable for checks, assume can't fetch

        if not active_conn: # Should be caught by above, but as a safeguard
             logger.error(f"DB connection unavailable for can_fetch_domain_now checks ({domain}). Assuming cannot fetch.")
             return False

        try:
            try:
                # Use the active_conn for this synchronous DB operation executed in a thread
                row = await asyncio.to_thread(self._db_get_last_fetch_sync, domain, active_conn)
                if row and row[0] is not None: 
                    last_fetch_time = row[0] 
            except Exception as e: 
                logger.error(f"Error checking last fetch time for {domain} ({type(e).__name__}: {e}). Assuming cannot fetch.")
                return False
                
            # Pass the same active_conn to get_crawl_delay
            crawl_delay = await self.get_crawl_delay(domain, active_conn)
            current_time = int(time.time())
            
            if current_time >= last_fetch_time + crawl_delay:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        finally:
            if conn_managed_internally and active_conn:
                self.storage.db_pool.return_connection(active_conn)

    def _db_record_fetch_sync(self, domain: str, current_time: int, conn_in: Optional[sqlite3.Connection] = None):
// ... existing code ...
```

I've refactored `can_fetch_domain_now` in `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py` to manage its database connection similarly to how `is_url_allowed` now does. It will obtain `active_conn` (either from `conn_in` or the pool) and pass it to both `_db_get_last_fetch_sync` and `get_crawl_delay`. It also handles returning the connection to the pool if it was acquired internally.

This change should make the assertion `politeness_enforcer.get_crawl_delay.assert_called_once_with(domain, mock_db_conn)` in `test_can_fetch_domain_now_insufficient_delay` pass, because `mock_db_conn` (which `active_conn` will be in the test) will be correctly passed to the mocked `get_crawl_delay`.

With these modifications to the source code (`politeness.py`), the existing test assertions in `test_politeness.py` should now align with the actual call patterns.

Shall we try running the tests again?

The user chose not to run the terminal command to execute the tests.

It seems we've addressed the likely causes for the test failures by:
1.  Refactoring `is_url_allowed` and `can_fetch_domain_now` in `politeness.py` to correctly manage a single database connection for their sequence of internal operations, passing this connection to helper methods.
2.  Ensuring the test assertions in `test_politeness.py` for the failing tests correctly expect the `conn_in` argument (which is the managed connection) to be passed to the mocked methods.

What would you like to do next? We can:
1.  Review the changes made to `crawler/crawler_module/politeness.py` again.
2.  Review the test files again.
3.  Attempt to run the tests if you're ready.
4.  Move on to something else if you believe these issues are resolved.

great they all pass

Excellent! I'm glad all the tests are passing now. The refactoring of connection handling in `is_url_allowed` and `can_fetch_domain_now`, along with the test adjustments, seems to have done the trick.

This should robustly address the original database pool exhaustion issue by ensuring that connection objects are passed down and reused within a single high-level operation, rather than each sub-operation trying to get a new connection from the pool.

Is there anything else I can help you with on this, or are you ready to move on to another task?
