I'm analyzing the logs of my crawler and it looks like there are some failed fetches when hitting URLs caused by SSL certificate issues. For example `curl -L http://sbomayman.com` fails with an error "SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name" but `curl -L -k http://sbomayman.com` succeeds and returns meaningful HTML. I don't think I care about secure connections in my crawler because i'm not going to be sending any sensitive data in forms. How can I modify the fetcher which uses aiohttp accordingly?

Looking at your issue, you want to disable SSL certificate verification in your aiohttp-based crawler, similar to using `curl -k`. This is a common requirement when crawling websites with self-signed or invalid certificates.

Let me modify your fetcher to ignore SSL certificate errors:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, Optional, Tuple

import aiohttp
import time
import cchardet # For fast character encoding detection
from aiohttp.client_reqrep import ClientResponse as AiohttpClientResponse # Correct import

from .config import CrawlerConfig

->

import asyncio
import logging
import ssl
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, Optional, Tuple

import aiohttp
import time
import cchardet # For fast character encoding detection
from aiohttp.client_reqrep import ClientResponse as AiohttpClientResponse # Correct import

from .config import CrawlerConfig
```

```python
    async def _get_session(self) -> aiohttp.ClientSession:
        """Returns the existing aiohttp session or creates a new one."""
        if self.session is None or self.session.closed:
            # Create a connector with conservative limits for high worker count
            # With 500 workers, we need to be careful about file descriptors
            max_total_connections = min(1000, self.config.max_workers * 2)  # Scale with workers
            max_per_host = max(5, min(20, max_total_connections // 50))  # Conservative per-host limit
            
            connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(
                limit=max_total_connections,  # Total connection pool limit
                limit_per_host=max_per_host,  # Max connections per host
                ttl_dns_cache=300,  # DNS cache timeout in seconds
                enable_cleanup_closed=True,  # Clean up closed connections
                force_close=True,  # Force close connections after each request to free up FDs
            )
            
            self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(
                timeout=self.timeout,
                headers={"User-Agent": self.config.user_agent},
                connector=connector,
            )
            logger.debug(f"Created new aiohttp.ClientSession with limit={max_total_connections}, limit_per_host={max_per_host}")
        return self.session

->

    async def _get_session(self) -> aiohttp.ClientSession:
        """Returns the existing aiohttp session or creates a new one."""
        if self.session is None or self.session.closed:
            # Create a connector with conservative limits for high worker count
            # With 500 workers, we need to be careful about file descriptors
            max_total_connections = min(1000, self.config.max_workers * 2)  # Scale with workers
            max_per_host = max(5, min(20, max_total_connections // 50))  # Conservative per-host limit
            
            # Create SSL context that doesn't verify certificates (similar to curl -k)
            ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()
            ssl_context.check_hostname = False
            ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
            
            connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(
                limit=max_total_connections,  # Total connection pool limit
                limit_per_host=max_per_host,  # Max connections per host
                ttl_dns_cache=300,  # DNS cache timeout in seconds
                enable_cleanup_closed=True,  # Clean up closed connections
                force_close=True,  # Force close connections after each request to free up FDs
                ssl=ssl_context,  # Use our SSL context that ignores certificate errors
            )
            
            self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(
                timeout=self.timeout,
                headers={"User-Agent": self.config.user_agent},
                connector=connector,
            )
            logger.debug(f"Created new aiohttp.ClientSession with limit={max_total_connections}, limit_per_host={max_per_host}, SSL verification disabled")
        return self.session
```

Let me also fix the linter errors in the test code while we're at it:

```python
# Example Usage (for testing and illustration)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from .config import parse_args # Assuming parse_args can be run without actual args for a default config

    # A simplified config for testing the fetcher directly
    @dataclass
    class DummyFetcherConfig:

->

# Example Usage (for testing and illustration)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pathlib import Path
    from .config import parse_args # Assuming parse_args can be run without actual args for a default config

    # A simplified config for testing the fetcher directly
    @dataclass
    class DummyFetcherConfig:
```

Perfect! I've modified your fetcher to disable SSL certificate verification, which is equivalent to using `curl -k`. Here's what I changed:

1. **Added SSL import**: Added `import ssl` at the top of the file.

2. **Modified the session creation**: In the `_get_session` method, I created an SSL context that doesn't verify certificates:
   - `ssl_context.check_hostname = False` - Disables hostname verification
   - `ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE` - Disables certificate verification entirely
   - Passed this context to the `TCPConnector` via the `ssl` parameter

3. **Fixed linter errors**: Added the missing `Path` import in the test code.

Now your crawler will be able to fetch from websites with invalid, self-signed, or mismatched SSL certificates, just like `curl -k` does. The crawler will no longer fail on SSL certificate errors.

This change is reasonable for a web crawler that's only reading public content and not submitting sensitive data. However, be aware that this does make your crawler vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, so you shouldn't use it for anything involving authentication or sensitive data transmission.
