We are resuming a debugging session on why our crawler does not scale beyond a low number of workers despite moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL. See the attached file cursor_fixing_tests_for_db_migrate_pt2_claude4opus.md. 

I modified the thundering herd mitigations to be even more extreme so that the rolling initialization is spread out even more. The problem persists which indicates that that it is not a thundering herd issue.

I modified db_backends.py so that each PostgreSQL connection will log a stack trace if the time that it is held (before being returned to the pool) is over some threshold. Here are some sample traces:

It looks like workers may be holding the connections for seconds at a time (which would explain why we see other workers being starved of the connections for 30+ seconds), and a common culprit is the atomic_claim_urls function. This continues to happen even if I reduce the batch size from 10 to 3. It's surprising to me that PostgreSQL is falling over at this scale (the frontier looks to be about 2M entries, but the warnings start happening even at a low number of workers, ~40). What could be happening?

---

**Cursor**

Okay, this is a very interesting clue! The fact that connections are held for several seconds within `_atomic_claim_urls` even with a small batch size and a moderate number of workers suggests that the query itself is slow, rather than just lock contention or thundering herd issues.

The `_atomic_claim_urls` function in `frontier.py` uses this query for PostgreSQL:
```sql
WITH to_claim AS (
    SELECT id, url, domain
    FROM frontier
    WHERE claimed_at IS NULL
    ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
    LIMIT %s  -- batch_size
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
UPDATE frontier
SET claimed_at = %s -- claim_timestamp
FROM to_claim
WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain
```

This query is quite optimized for concurrency, but its performance heavily depends on the underlying table structure and indexes. If this query is slow, it will hold the connection for the duration of its execution, starving other workers.

Here are the primary suspects for the slowness:

1.  **Missing or Inefficient Indexes**: This is the most likely culprit.
    *   The `WHERE claimed_at IS NULL` clause needs an efficient way to find rows.
    *   The `ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC` clause needs an index to avoid a full sort.
    *   The `LIMIT` clause benefits greatly from an ordered index.
    *   The `UPDATE ... WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id` part relies on the primary key index for `frontier.id`, which should be efficient.

    A composite index like `(claimed_at, added_timestamp)` could be highly beneficial. If `claimed_at` is mostly `NULL`, then an index on `(added_timestamp)` with a partial index condition `WHERE claimed_at IS NULL` might be even better.

2.  **Table Bloat / Statistics**: If the `frontier` table undergoes many updates (claiming and unclaiming URLs), it might become bloated, or its statistics might be stale, leading PostgreSQL to choose a suboptimal query plan. `VACUUM ANALYZE frontier;` could help.

3.  **Suboptimal Query Plan**: PostgreSQL's query planner might be making a poor choice. We can investigate this using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

Let's start by examining the current schema and indexes for the `frontier` table. I'll look for the table definition in `storage.py`.


```sql
WITH to_claim AS (
    SELECT id, url, domain
    FROM frontier
    WHERE claimed_at IS NULL
    ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
    LIMIT %s  -- batch_size
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
UPDATE frontier
SET claimed_at = %s -- claim_timestamp
FROM to_claim
WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain
```

Okay, it seems the `CREATE TABLE` statement for `frontier` isn't directly in `storage.py` with that exact string, or my search was too narrow. The schema initialization might be more dynamic or split into versions.

Let me try reading the relevant parts of `storage.py` that handle schema initialization to understand how the `frontier` table is defined. I'll look for methods like `_initialize_schema`, `_create_tables`, or similar, and focus on the `frontier` table.


Okay, I've found the schema definition in `crawler/crawler_module/storage.py`.

Here's the `frontier` table definition and its indexes:

```sql
-- For PostgreSQL:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS frontier (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    depth INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    added_timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
    priority_score REAL DEFAULT 0,
    claimed_at BIGINT DEFAULT NULL
);

-- Indexes created:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_domain ON frontier (domain);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_priority ON frontier (priority_score, added_timestamp);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed ON frontier (claimed_at);
```

The query in `_atomic_claim_urls` is:
```sql
WITH to_claim AS (
    SELECT id, url, domain
    FROM frontier
    WHERE claimed_at IS NULL  -- Uses idx_frontier_claimed
    ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
    LIMIT %s
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
UPDATE frontier
SET claimed_at = %s
FROM to_claim
WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain
```

Current indexes relevant to the query:
1.  `idx_frontier_claimed ON frontier (claimed_at)`: This index will be used for the `WHERE claimed_at IS NULL` condition.
2.  The `ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC` clause does *not* have a dedicated index that perfectly matches this condition in combination with `claimed_at IS NULL`.

**Potential Issue:**
After filtering by `claimed_at IS NULL` (which could still be a very large number of rows, potentially most of the table if the crawler is struggling to keep up), PostgreSQL then has to sort these rows by `added_timestamp`. If the number of rows with `claimed_at IS NULL` is large (e.g., millions), this sort operation can be very expensive and slow, even before applying the `LIMIT`.

**Recommendation:**

To optimize this, we can try adding a composite index that better serves both the filtering and ordering:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp ASC);
```

*However*, PostgreSQL might not efficiently use this for `claimed_at IS NULL`. A more effective index for `claimed_at IS NULL` and `ORDER BY added_timestamp` would be a **partial index**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time ON frontier (added_timestamp ASC) WHERE claimed_at IS NULL;
```

This index `idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time` would be specifically for rows where `claimed_at` is `NULL`, and it would already be sorted by `added_timestamp`. This should allow PostgreSQL to very quickly find the `LIMIT N` oldest unclaimed URLs.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Apply the new partial index.**
2.  **Analyze the table.** After adding the index, it's crucial to run `ANALYZE frontier;` so PostgreSQL's query planner is aware of the new index and updated table statistics.
3.  **Test.** Rerun the crawler and observe if the connection hold times and timeout errors improve.
4.  **If issues persist:** Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the problematic query to see the exact query plan PostgreSQL is using.

I will prepare the command to add this index. Since this is a schema change, it should ideally be added to the `_create_tables` method in `storage.py` for future initializations. For an existing database, you'll need to apply it manually via `psql`.

Let's modify `storage.py` to include this new index.
I will also remove the simple `idx_frontier_claimed` as the new partial index or a composite index `(claimed_at, added_timestamp)` would be more comprehensive for the query in question. The partial index is generally more efficient for `IS NULL` conditions on columns with many nulls.

I will modify `storage.py` to include the new partial index `idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time` and remove the simple `idx_frontier_claimed`.

Here's the plan:
1.  Modify `storage.py` to add the new partial index `idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time` during schema creation/upgrade.
2.  Suggest that you manually apply this index to your *existing* PostgreSQL database and run `ANALYZE frontier;`.

Let's proceed with editing `storage.py`.

                await self.db.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_priority ON frontier (priority_score, added_timestamp)")
                
                # Add claimed_at column if upgrading from version 1 (SQLite only)

                        logger.info("Added claimed_at column to frontier table")
                    except:

                      # A simple index on claimed_at and added_timestamp is the fallback.
                      # Or just (claimed_at) if that's better than nothing given SQLite's limitations.
                      # For now, let's stick to the existing claimed_at for SQLite or consider a composite.
                      # The original code had "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed ON frontier (claimed_at)"
                      # Let's keep that for SQLite, as partial indexes are more complex there.
                    await self.db.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp_sqlite ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp)")


                # Visited URLs Table
// ... existing code ...

```

The linter error for `aiofiles` is unrelated to the change I made and is a pre-existing issue regarding type stubs. I will ignore it.

The edit has been applied. For SQLite, I've added a composite index `idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp_sqlite ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp)` as a fallback since partial indexes like the one for PostgreSQL are not as straightforward or might not be as effective depending on the SQLite version and query planner. This composite index is better than just `idx_frontier_claimed` for the query.

**Crucial Next Steps for You:**

1.  **Manually Apply to Existing DB (PostgreSQL):**
    Since your database already exists, the code change in `storage.py` will only affect new database initializations or future schema migrations if you increment `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION` and add upgrade logic.
    You need to manually create the new index and drop the old one on your current PostgreSQL database. Connect to your `web_crawler` database using `psql` and run:
    ```sql
    -- Drop the old, less effective index
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new, more efficient partial index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time ON frontier (added_timestamp ASC) WHERE claimed_at IS NULL;

    -- VERY IMPORTANT: Analyze the table so the query planner uses the new index
    ANALYZE frontier;
    ```

2.  **Manually Apply to Existing DB (SQLite - if you switch back or for testing):**
    If you were using SQLite and wanted a similar improvement, you'd run:
    ```sql
    -- Drop the old index (if you were using just idx_frontier_claimed)
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new composite index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp_sqlite ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp);

    -- Analyze the table (good practice, though SQLite's analyze is different)
    ANALYZE frontier;
    ```
    (The code change I made to `storage.py` will handle this for new SQLite DBs).

3.  **Test the Crawler:**
    After applying the index and analyzing the table, restart your crawler with the previous configuration (e.g., ~40 workers or your problematic scenario). Monitor:
    *   The "Connection held for Xs" warnings. They should ideally disappear or report much shorter times.
    *   The "couldn't get a connection after 30.00 sec" errors. These should reduce significantly or be eliminated.
    *   Overall crawler throughput and stability.

**If the Problem Persists:**

If you still see long hold times, the next step is to get the actual query plan:

1.  Connect to `psql`.
2.  Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the query. You'll need to substitute the placeholders (`%s`) with example values. For a batch size of 3, it would be:

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    WITH to_claim AS (
        SELECT id, url, domain
        FROM frontier
        WHERE claimed_at IS NULL
        ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
        LIMIT 3 -- Example batch_size
        FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    )
    UPDATE frontier
    SET claimed_at = 1234567890 -- Example timestamp
    FROM to_claim
    WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
    RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain;
    ```
    Share the output of this `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. It will show exactly how PostgreSQL is executing the query and whether it's using the new index.

This indexing change has a high probability of resolving the performance bottleneck in `_atomic_claim_urls`. Let me know how the testing goes after you've applied the index.

```sql
    -- Drop the old, less effective index
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new, more efficient partial index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time ON frontier (added_timestamp ASC) WHERE claimed_at IS NULL;

    -- VERY IMPORTANT: Analyze the table so the query planner uses the new index
    ANALYZE frontier;
```

```sql
    -- Drop the old index (if you were using just idx_frontier_claimed)
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new composite index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp_sqlite ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp);

    -- Analyze the table (good practice, though SQLite's analyze is different)
    ANALYZE frontier;
```

```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    WITH to_claim AS (
        SELECT id, url, domain
        FROM frontier
        WHERE claimed_at IS NULL
        ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
        LIMIT 3 -- Example batch_size
        FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    )
    UPDATE frontier
    SET claimed_at = 1234567890 -- Example timestamp
    FROM to_claim
    WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
    RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain;
```

```sql
    -- Drop the old, less effective index
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new, more efficient partial index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_unclaimed_order_by_time ON frontier (added_timestamp ASC) WHERE claimed_at IS NULL;

    -- VERY IMPORTANT: Analyze the table so the query planner uses the new index
    ANALYZE frontier;
```

```sql
    -- Drop the old index (if you were using just idx_frontier_claimed)
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed;

    -- Create the new composite index
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_frontier_claimed_at_added_timestamp_sqlite ON frontier (claimed_at, added_timestamp);

    -- Analyze the table (good practice, though SQLite's analyze is different)
    ANALYZE frontier;
```

```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    WITH to_claim AS (
        SELECT id, url, domain
        FROM frontier
        WHERE claimed_at IS NULL
        ORDER BY added_timestamp ASC
        LIMIT 3 -- Example batch_size
        FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    )
    UPDATE frontier
    SET claimed_at = 1234567890 -- Example timestamp
    FROM to_claim
    WHERE frontier.id = to_claim.id
    RETURNING frontier.id, frontier.url, frontier.domain;
```
