# Flight Simulator Development Plan

## Project Overview
A web-based flight simulator featuring a Cessna aircraft with realistic flight physics in a 3D environment.

## Core Features

### 1. **Aircraft Model & Physics**
- Cessna 172 3D model
- Realistic flight physics including:
  - Lift, drag, thrust, and weight forces
  - Pitch, roll, and yaw controls
  - Stall mechanics
  - Ground physics for takeoff/landing
- Instrument panel with:
  - Airspeed indicator
  - Altimeter
  - Artificial horizon
  - Heading indicator
  - Vertical speed indicator

### 2. **Controls**
- **Keyboard Controls:**
  - W/S: Elevator (pitch up/down)
  - A/D: Ailerons (roll left/right)
  - Q/E: Rudder (yaw left/right)
  - Arrow Up/Down: Throttle control
  - G: Landing gear toggle
  - F: Flaps toggle
  - B: Brakes
  - Space: Reset position
- **Mouse Controls:**
  - Click and drag for camera rotation
  - Scroll wheel for zoom

### 3. **3D Environment**
- Terrain with elevation variations
- Runway and airport
- Sky with clouds
- Day/night cycle (optional)
- Basic weather effects (wind)
- Trees and buildings for visual reference

### 4. **Camera System**
- Multiple camera views:
  - Cockpit view (first person)
  - External chase camera
  - Free camera
  - Tower view
- Smooth camera transitions

### 5. **User Interface**
- HUD displaying:
  - Speed, altitude, heading
  - Throttle percentage
  - Gear/flaps status
- Mini-map showing position
- Help overlay with controls
- Settings menu for graphics quality

## Technical Architecture

### Technologies
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics rendering
- **Cannon.js** or custom physics: Flight dynamics
- **HTML5/CSS3**: UI components
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server

4. Performance optimization
5. Final testing and adjustments

## Additional Features (Time Permitting)
- Multiple aircraft types
- Missions or challenges
- Multiplayer support
- VR mode
- Replay system
- Advanced weather (rain, fog)
- Night lighting
- Damage model

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Realism Level**: How realistic should the flight physics be? Should we prioritize fun/accessibility or simulation accuracy?

2. **World Size**: How large should the flying area be? A small island, or a larger region?

3. **Graphics Quality**: Should we prioritize performance for smooth gameplay or higher quality visuals?

4. **Additional Features**: Are there any specific features from the "Additional Features" list that are must-haves?

5. **Target Performance**: What's the minimum acceptable frame rate? (e.g., 30 FPS, 60 FPS)

## Development Timeline
- Phase 1-2: 2-3 hours (Basic flyable aircraft)
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours (Realistic physics)
- Phase 4-5: 2-3 hours (Environment and polish)

Total estimated time: 6-9 hours for a complete, polished simulator

Would you like me to proceed with the implementation based on this plan, or would you like to clarify any of the questions above first?
