Build a flight simulator in the directory `flight-simulator`. The program should run in my web browser and allow me to fly around in a cessna around a 3D environment.

Work only in the directory `flight-simulator`. Do not edit files outside. Make a plan before beginning to code in a file `PLAN.MD`, feel free to add any features you feel are important or ask me clarifying questions when making the plan.
